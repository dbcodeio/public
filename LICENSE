### SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT


## 1. Grant of License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Software License Agreement ("Agreement"), Recut LLC ("Licensor"), a Delaware limited liability company with a registered address at 5580 La Jolla Blvd #26 San Diego, CA 92037, grants the user ("Licensee") a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to download, install, and use the DBCode Extension ("Extension") on unlimited devices for personal or business purposes.

By downloading, installing, using, or copying the Extension, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, you may not download, install, use or copy the Extension.

This Extension is licensed, not sold. Licensor reserves all other rights not granted by this Agreement.

## 1.1 Perpetual License

Upon completion of one full year of payments, either through annual or monthly payments, Licensee is granted a perpetual license to use the Pro or Team version of the Extension available at the end of the purchase term, excluding any online services. This perpetual license allows continued use of that version without the need for an active subscription, though online service limitations apply.

## 1.2 Lifetime License

Upon purchasing a lifetime license, Licensee is granted a lifetime license to use the Pro or Team version of the Extension, including access to all future updates and versions released by Licensor. This lifetime license allows continued use of the Extension without the need for an active subscription. However, online services may become unavailable if the company ceases operations or discontinues the service.

## 2. Restrictions

#### a. Modification and Reverse Engineering:

Licensee shall not modify, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Extension.

#### b. Distribution:

Licensee shall not distribute, sublicense, or transfer the Extension to third parties without prior written consent from Licensor.

#### c. Open-Source Components:

The restrictions in this Section 2 apply only to the proprietary portions of the Extension. Open-Source Components included in the Extension remain subject to their original open-source licenses, and Licensee's rights to those components are governed by their respective licenses, not this Agreement.

## 3. Intellectual Property

#### a. Ownership:

The Extension, excluding Open-Source Components (as defined in Section 8), and all worldwide copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights in the proprietary portions thereof are the exclusive property of the Licensor. The Licensor reserves all rights in and to the Extension not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement. Open-Source Components retain their original licenses and ownership as specified by their respective copyright holders.

#### b. User-Generated Content:

Any content generated by Licensee using the Extension remains the property of Licensee.

## 4. Updates and Support

Licensor may, at its discretion, provide updates or support for the Extension. Licensee acknowledges that continued use may require acceptance of such updates unless using the software under the terms of the perpetual license. For lifetime license holders, all updates and new versions are included at no additional cost. However, online services may become unavailable if the company ceases operations or discontinues the service.

## 5. Termination

Licensor reserves the right to terminate this license at any time for breach of terms. Upon termination, Licensee must cease using the Extension and uninstall it from all devices. The perpetuity of the perpetual license remains valid upon completion of the initial payment period, and the lifetime license remains valid upon purchase, notwithstanding usage violations. However, online services may become unavailable if the company ceases operations or discontinues the service.

## 6. Warranty Disclaimer

The Extension is provided on an "as is" basis, without any warranties, either express or implied, or guarantees of performance, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Licensor does not warrant that the Extension will be error-free or meet Licensee's requirements or any errors in the Extension will be corrected. YOUR USE OF THE EXTENSION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

Licensee expressly understands and agrees that Licensor shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, exemplary, consequential, or incidental damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses arising out of the use or inability to use the Extension (even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages). In no event shall Licensor's liability exceed the amount paid in the previous twelve months, if any, for the Extension.

Licensor reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Extension (or any part thereof) with or without notice. The Licensor shall not be liable to Licensee or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Extension.

## 8. Open Source Notices

Certain components of the Extension utilize open-source software ("Open-Source Components"). These components are governed by their original open-source licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative or similar licensing agreements. The Licensor does not claim ownership of these Open-Source Components, which remain the property of their respective copyright holders.
