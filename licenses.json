For react-native, it can be\nenabled via instructions found at [reactnative.dev/blog](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/package-exports-support).\n\nThink of `@aws-sdk/core` as a mono-package within the monorepo.\nIt preserves the benefits of modularization, for example to optimize Node.js initialization speed,\nwhile making it easier to have a consistent version of core dependencies, reducing package sprawl when\ninstalling an SDK client.\n\n### Guide for submodules\n\n- Each `index.ts` file corresponding to the pattern `./src/submodules/<MODULE_NAME>/index.ts` will be\n  published as a separate `dist-cjs` bundled submodule index using the `Inliner.js` build script.\n- create a folder as `./src/submodules/<SUBMODULE>` including an `index.ts` file and a `README.md` file.\n  - The linter will throw an error on missing submodule metadata in `package.json` and the various `tsconfig.json` files, but it will automatically fix them if possible.\n- a submodule is equivalent to a standalone `@aws-sdk/<pkg>` package in that importing it in Node.js will resolve a separate bundle.\n- submodules may not relatively import files from other submodules. Instead, directly use the `@scope/pkg/submodule` name as the import.\n  - The linter will check for this and throw an error.\n- To the extent possible, correctly declaring submodule metadata is validated by the linter in `@aws-sdk/core`.\n  The linter runs during `yarn build` and also as `yarn lint`.\n\n### When should I create an `@aws-sdk/core/submodule` vs. `@aws-sdk/new-package`?\n\nKeep in mind that the core package is installed by all AWS SDK clients.\n\nIf the component functionality is upstream of multiple clients, it is\na good candidate for a core submodule. For example, XML serialization.\n\nIf the component's functionality is downstream of a client, for example S3 pre-signing,\nit should be a standalone package with potentially a peer or runtime dependency on an AWS SDK client.",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It can be used for example, for comparing files, and can produce difference information in various formats, including context and unified diffs. Ported from Python's [difflib](http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html) module.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n#### Browser\n\nTo use it in the browser, you may download the [minified js file](https://github.com/qiao/difflib.js/raw/master/dist/difflib-browser.js) and include it in your webpage.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./difflib-browser.js\"></script>\n```\n\n#### Node.js\n\nFor Node.js, you can install it using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n```bash\nnpm install difflib\n```\n\nThen, in your script:\n\n```js\nvar difflib = require('difflib');\n```\n\nQuick Examples\n--------------\n\n1. contextDiff\n\n    ```js\n    >>> s1 = ['bacon\\n', 'eggs\\n', 'ham\\n', 'guido\\n']\n    >>> s2 = ['python\\n', 'eggy\\n', 'hamster\\n', 'guido\\n']\n    >>> difflib.contextDiff(s1, s2, {fromfile:'before.py', tofile:'after.py'})\n    [ '*** before.py\\n',\n      '--- after.py\\n',\n      '***************\\n',\n      '*** 1,4 ****\\n',\n      '! bacon\\n',\n      '! eggs\\n',\n      '! ham\\n',\n      '  guido\\n',\n      '--- 1,4 ----\\n',\n      '! python\\n',\n      '! eggy\\n',\n      '! hamster\\n',\n      '  guido\\n' ]\n    ```\n\n2. unifiedDiff\n\n    ```js\n    >>> difflib.unifiedDiff('one two three four'.split(' '),\n    ...

The second sequence to be compared is not changed.\n\n<a name=\"setSeq2\" />\n#### setSeq2(a)\n\nSet the second sequence to be compared. The first sequence to be compared is not changed.\n\n<a name=\"findLongestMatch\" />\n#### findLongestMatch(alo, ahi, blo, bhi)\n\nFind longest matching block in `a[alo:ahi]` and `b[blo:bhi]`.\n\nIf *isjunk* was omitted or null, *findLongestMatch()* returns `[i, j, k]` such that \n`a[i:i+k]` is equal to `b[j:j+k]`, where `alo <= i <= i+k <= ahi` and \n`blo <= j <= j+k <= bhi`. \nFor all `[i', j', k']` meeting those conditions, the additional conditions `k >= k'`, \n`i <= i'`, and if `i == i'`, `j <= j'` are also met. \nIn other words, of all maximal matching blocks, return one that starts earliest in *a*,\nand of all those maximal matching blocks that start earliest in *a*, \nreturn the one that starts earliest in *b*.\n\n```js\n>>> s = new difflib.SequenceMatcher(null, \" abcd\", \"abcd abcd\");\n>>> s.findLongestMatch(0, 5, 0, 9);\n[0, 4, 5]\n```\n\nIf *isjunk* was provided, first the longest matching block is determined\nas above, but with the additional restriction that no junk element appears\nin the block. \nThen that block is extended as far as possible by matching (only) junk \nelements on both sides. So the resulting block never matches on junk \nexcept as identical junk happens to be adjacent to an interesting match.\n\nHere's the same example as before, but considering blanks to be junk. \nThat prevents `' abcd'` from matching the `' abcd'` at the tail end of \nthe second sequence directly. \nInstead only the `'abcd'` can match, and matches the leftmost `'abcd'` \nin the second sequence:\n\n```js\n>>> s = new difflib.SequenceMatcher(function(x) {return x == ' ';}, \" abcd\", \"abcd abcd\")\n>>> s.findLongestMatch(0, 5, 0, 9)\n[1, 0, 4]\n```\n\nIf no blocks match, this returns `[alo, blo, 0]`.\n\n\n<a name=\"getMatchingBlocks\" />\n#### getMatchingBlocks()\n\nReturn list of triples describing matching subsequences. \nEach triple is of the form `[i, j, n]`, and means that `a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n]`. \nThe triples are monotonically increasing in *i* and *j*.\n\nThe last triple is a dummy, and has the value `[a.length, b.length, 0]`.\nIt is the only triple with `n == 0`. If `[i, j, n]` and `[i', j', n']` \nare adjacent triples in the list, and the second is not the last triple \nin the list, then `i+n != i'` or `j+n != j'`; \nin other words, adjacent triples always describe non-adjacent equal blocks.\n\n```js\n>>> s = new difflib.SequenceMatcher(null, \"abxcd\", \"abcd\")\n>>> s.getMatchingBlocks()\n[ [0, 0, 2], [3, 2, 2], [5, 4, 0] ]\n```\n\n<a name=\"getOpcodes\" />\n#### getOpcodes()\n\nReturn list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b. \nEach tuple is of the form `[tag, i1, i2, j1, j2]`. \nThe first tuple has `i1 == j1 == 0`, and remaining tuples \nhave *i1* equal to the *i2* from the preceding tuple, \nand, likewise, *j1* equal to the previous *j2*.\n\nThe tag values are strings, with these meanings:\n\n    Value       Meaning\n\n    'replace'   a[i1:i2] should be replaced by b[j1:j2].\n    'delete'    a[i1:i2] should be deleted. Note that j1 == j2 in this case.\n    'insert'    b[j1:j2] should be inserted at a[i1:i1]. Note that i1 == i2 in this case.\n    'equal'     a[i1:i2] == b[j1:j2] (the sub-sequences are equal).\n\n```js\n>>> s = new difflib.SequenceMatcher(null, 'qabxcd', 'abycdf');\n>>> s.getOpcodes();\n[ [ 'delete'  , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 ] ,\n  [ 'equal'   , 1 , 3 , 0 , 2 ] ,\n  [ 'replace' , 3 , 4 , 2 , 3 ] ,\n  [ 'equal'   , 4 , 6 , 3 , 5 ] ,\n  [ 'insert'  , 6 , 6 , 5 , 6 ] ]\n```\n\n<a name=\"getGroupedOpcodes\" />\n#### getGroupedOpcodes([n])\n\nReturn a list groups with upto n (default is 3) lines of context.\nEach group is in the same format as returned by [getOpcodes()](#getOpcodes).\n\n<a name=\"ratio\" />\n#### ratio()\n\nReturn a measure of the sequences’ similarity as a float in the range [0, 1].\n\nWhere T is the total number of elements in both sequences, \nand M is the number of matches, this is 2.0*M / T. \nNote that this is `1.0` if the sequences are identical, \nand `0.0` if they have nothing in common.\n\nThis is expensive to compute if [getMatchingBlocks()](#getMatchingBlocks) or \n[getOpcodes()](#getOpcodes) hasn’t already been called, in which case \nyou may want to try [quickRatio()](#quickRatio) or \n[realQuickRatio()](#realQuickRatio) first to get an upper bound.\n\n<a name=\"quickRatio\" />\n#### quickRatio()\n\nReturn an upper bound on ratio() relatively quickly.\n\n<a name=\"realQuickRatio\" />\n#### realQuickRatio()\n\nReturn an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.\n\n```js\n>>> s = new difflib.SequenceMatcher(null, 'abcd', 'bcde');\n>>> s.ratio();\n0.75\n>>> s.quickRatio();\n0.75\n>>> s.realQuickRatio();\n1.0\n```\n\n<a name=\"Differ\" />\n### *class* difflib.**Differ**([linejunk[, charjunk]])\n\nThis is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, \nand producing human-readable differences or deltas. \nDiffer uses [SequenceMatcher](#SequenceMatcher) both to compare \nsequences of lines, and to compare sequences of characters within \nsimilar (near-matching) lines.\n\nEach line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:\n\n    Code    Meaning\n    '- '    line unique to sequence 1\n    '+ '    line unique to sequence 2\n    '  '    line common to both sequences\n    '?

        "licenseTxt": "# @lit-labs/ssr-dom-shim\n\n## Overview\n\nThis package provides minimal implementations of `Element`, `HTMLElement`,\n`CustomElementRegistry`, and `customElements`, designed to be used when Server\nSide Rendering (SSR) web components from Node, including Lit components.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Usage from Lit\n\nLit itself automatically imports these shims when running in Node, so Lit users\nshould typically not need to directly depend on or import from this package.\n\nSee the [lit.dev SSR docs](https://lit.dev/docs/ssr/overview/) for general\ninformation about server-side rendering with Lit.\n\n### Usage in other contexts\n\nOther libraries or frameworks who wish to support SSR are welcome to also depend\non these shims. (This package is planned to eventually move to\n`@webcomponents/ssr-dom-shim` to better reflect this use case). There are two\nmain patterns for providing access to these shims to users:\n\n1. Assigning shims to `globalThis`, ensuring that assignment occurs before\n   user-code runs.\n\n2. Importing shims directly from the module that provides your base class, using\n   the `node` [export\n   condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) to\n   ensure this only happens when running in Node, and not in the browser.\n\nLit takes approach #2 for all of the shims except for `customElements`, so that\nusers who have imported `lit` are able to call `customElements.define` in their\ncomponents from Node.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe main module exports the following values. Note that no globals are set by\nthis module.\n\n- [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)\n  - [`attachShadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow)\n  - [`shadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/shadowRoot)\n  - [`attributes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes)\n  - [`hasAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/hasAttribute)\n  - [`getAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute)\n  - [`setAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute)\n  - [`removeAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute)\n- [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)\n  - (Inherits from Element)\n- [`CustomElementRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry)\n- [`customElements`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/customElements)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It extends the [Node Redis client](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) to include functions for each of the RedisJSON commands.\n\nTo use these extra commands, your Redis server must have the RedisJSON module installed.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor a complete example, see [`managing-json.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/managing-json.js) in the Node Redis examples folder.\n\n### Storing JSON Documents in Redis\n\nThe [`JSON.SET`](https://redis.io/commands/json.set/) command stores a JSON value at a given JSON Path in a Redis key.\n\nHere, we'll store a JSON document in the root of the Redis key \"`mydoc`\":\n\n```javascript\nimport { createClient } from 'redis';\n\n...\nawait client.json.set('noderedis:jsondata', '$', {\n  name: 'Roberta McDonald',\n  pets: [\n    {\n    name: 'Rex',\n    species: 'dog',\n    age: 3,\n    isMammal: true\n    },\n    {\n    name: 'Goldie',\n    species: 'fish',\n    age: 2,\n    isMammal: false\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nFor more information about RedisJSON's path syntax, [check out the documentation](https://redis.io/docs/stack/json/path/).\n\n### Retrieving JSON Documents from Redis\n\nWith RedisJSON, we can retrieve all or part(s) of a JSON document using the [`JSON.GET`](https://redis.io/commands/json.get/) command and one or more JSON Paths.  Let's get the name and age of one of the pets:\n\n```javascript\nconst results = await client.json.get('noderedis:jsondata', {\n  path: [\n    '.pets[1].name',\n    '.pets[1].age'\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n`results` will contain the following:\n\n```javascript\n { '.pets[1].name': 'Goldie', '.pets[1].age': 2 }\n```\n\n### Performing Atomic Updates on JSON Documents Stored in Redis\n\nRedisJSON includes commands that can atomically update values in a JSON document, in place in Redis without having to first retrieve the entire document.\n\nUsing the [`JSON.NUMINCRBY`](https://redis.io/commands/json.numincrby/) command, we can update the age of one of the pets like this:\n\n```javascript\nawait client.json.numIncrBy('noderedis:jsondata', '.pets[1].age', 1);\n```\n\nAnd we can add a new object to the pets array with the [`JSON.ARRAPPEND`](https://redis.io/commands/json.arrappend/) command:\n\n```javascript\nawait client.json.arrAppend('noderedis:jsondata', '.pets', {\n  name: 'Robin',\n  species: 'bird',\n  age: 1,\n  isMammal: false\n});\n```",

It extends the [Node Redis client](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) to include functions for each of the RediSearch commands.\n\nTo use these extra commands, your Redis server must have the RediSearch module installed.  To index and query JSON documents, you'll also need to add the RedisJSON module.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor complete examples, see [`search-hashes.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/search-hashes.js) and [`search-json.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/search-json.js) in the Node Redis examples folder.\n\n### Indexing and Querying Data in Redis Hashes\n\n#### Creating an Index\n\nBefore we can perform any searches, we need to tell RediSearch how to index our data, and which Redis keys to find that data in.  The [FT.CREATE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create) command creates a RediSearch index.  Here's how to use it to create an index we'll call `idx:animals` where we want to index hashes containing `name`, `species` and `age` fields, and whose key names in Redis begin with the prefix `noderedis:animals`:\n\n```javascript\nawait client.ft.create('idx:animals', {\n  name: {\n    type: SchemaFieldTypes.TEXT,\n    SORTABLE: true\n  },\n  species: SchemaFieldTypes.TAG,\n  age: SchemaFieldTypes.NUMERIC\n}, {\n  ON: 'HASH',\n  PREFIX: 'noderedis:animals'\n});\n```\n\nSee the [`FT.CREATE` documentation](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/#description) for information about the different field types and additional options.\n\n#### Querying the Index\n\nOnce we've created an index, and added some data to Redis hashes whose keys begin with the prefix `noderedis:animals`, we can start writing some search queries.  RediSearch supports a rich query syntax for full-text search, faceted search, aggregation and more.  Check out the [`FT.SEARCH` documentation](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search) and the [query syntax reference](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/query) for more information.\n\nLet's write a query to find all the animals where the `species` field has the value `dog`:\n\n```javascript\nconst results = await client.ft.search('idx:animals', '@species:{dog}');\n```\n\n`results` looks like this:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  total: 2,\n  documents: [\n    {\n      id: 'noderedis:animals:4',\n      value: {\n        name: 'Fido',\n        species: 'dog',\n        age: '7'\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'noderedis:animals:3',\n      value: {\n        name: 'Rover',\n        species: 'dog',\n        age: '9'\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Indexing and Querying Data with RedisJSON\n\nRediSearch can also index and query JSON documents stored in Redis using the RedisJSON module.  The approach is similar to that for indexing and searching data in hashes, but we can now use JSON Path like syntax and the data no longer has to be flat name/value pairs - it can contain nested objects and arrays.\n\n#### Creating an Index\n\nAs before, we create an index with the `FT.CREATE` command, this time specifying we want to index JSON documents that look like this:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  name: 'Alice',\n  age: 32,\n  coins: 100\n}\n```\n\nEach document represents a user in some system, and users have name, age and coins properties.\n\nOne way we might choose to index these documents is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nawait client.ft.create('idx:users', {\n  '$.name': {\n    type: SchemaFieldTypes.TEXT,\n    SORTABLE: 'UNF'\n  },\n  '$.age': {\n    type: SchemaFieldTypes.NUMERIC,\n    AS: 'age'\n  },\n  '$.coins': {\n    type: SchemaFieldTypes.NUMERIC,\n    AS: 'coins'\n  }\n}, {\n  ON: 'JSON',\n  PREFIX: 'noderedis:users'\n});\n```\n\nNote that we're using JSON Path to specify where the fields to index are in our JSON documents, and the `AS` clause to define a name/alias for each field.  We'll use these when writing queries.\n\n#### Querying the Index\n\nNow we have an index and some data stored as JSON documents in Redis (see the [JSON package documentation](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/json) for examples of how to store JSON), we can write some queries...\n\nWe'll use the [RediSearch query language](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/query) and [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search) command.  Here's a query to find users under the age of 30:\n\n```javascript\nawait client.ft.search('idx:users', '@age:[0 30]');\n```",

It extends the [Node Redis client](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) to include functions for each of the RedisTimeSeries commands.\n\nTo use these extra commands, your Redis server must have the RedisTimeSeries module installed.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor a complete example, see [`time-series.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/time-series.js) in the Node Redis examples folder.\n\n### Creating Time Series data structure in Redis\n\nThe [`TS.CREATE`](https://oss.redis.com/redistimeseries/commands/#tscreate) command creates a new time series.\n\nHere, we'll create a new time series \"`temperature`\":\n\n```javascript\n\nimport { createClient } from 'redis';\nimport { TimeSeriesDuplicatePolicies, TimeSeriesEncoding, TimeSeriesAggregationType } from '@redis/time-series';\n\n...\n\n const created = await client.ts.create('temperature', {\n    RETENTION: 86400000, // 1 day in milliseconds\n    ENCODING: TimeSeriesEncoding.UNCOMPRESSED, // No compression - When not specified, the option is set to COMPRESSED\n    DUPLICATE_POLICY: TimeSeriesDuplicatePolicies.BLOCK, // No duplicates - When not specified: set to the global DUPLICATE_POLICY configuration of the database (which by default, is BLOCK).\n  });\n\n    if (created === 'OK') {\n    console.log('Created timeseries.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Error creating timeseries :(');\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n\n```\n\n### Adding new value to a Time Series data structure in Redis\n\nWith RedisTimeSeries, we can add a single value to time series data structure using the [`TS.ADD`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.add/) command and if we would like to add multiple values we can use the [`TS.MADD`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.madd/) command.\n\n```javascript\n\nlet value = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1; // Random data point value\n  let currentTimestamp = 1640995200000; // Jan 1 2022 00:00:00\n  let num = 0;\n\n  while (num < 10000) {\n    // Add a new value to the timeseries, providing our own timestamp:\n    // https://redis.io/commands/ts.add/\n    await client.ts.add('temperature', currentTimestamp, value);\n    console.log(`Added timestamp ${currentTimestamp}, value ${value}.`);\n\n    num += 1;\n    value = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1; // Get another random value\n    currentTimestamp += 1000; // Move on one second.\n  }\n\n  // Add multiple values to the timeseries in round trip to the server:\n  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.madd/\n  const response = await client.ts.mAdd([{\n    key: 'temperature',\n    timestamp: currentTimestamp + 60000,\n    value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1\n  }, {\n    key: 'temperature',\n    timestamp: currentTimestamp + 120000,\n    value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1\n  }]);\n\n\n```\n\n### Retrieving Time Series data from Redis\n\nWith RedisTimeSeries, we can retrieve the time series data using the [`TS.RANGE`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.range/) command by passing the criteria as follows:\n\n```javascript\n\n// Query the timeseries with TS.RANGE:\n  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.range/\n  const fromTimestamp = 1640995200000; // Jan 1 2022 00:00:00\n  const toTimestamp = 1640995260000; // Jan 1 2022 00:01:00\n  const rangeResponse = await client.ts.range('temperature', fromTimestamp, toTimestamp, {\n    // Group into 10 second averages.\n    AGGREGATION: {\n      type: TimeSeriesAggregationType.AVERAGE,\n      timeBucket: 10000\n    }\n  });\n\n  console.log('RANGE RESPONSE:');\n  // rangeResponse looks like:\n  // [\n  //   { timestamp: 1640995200000, value: 356.8 },\n  //   { timestamp: 1640995210000, value: 534.8 },\n  //   { timestamp: 1640995220000, value: 481.3 },\n  //   { timestamp: 1640995230000, value: 437 },\n  //   { timestamp: 1640995240000, value: 507.3 },\n  //   { timestamp: 1640995250000, value: 581.2 },\n  //   { timestamp: 1640995260000, value: 600 }\n  // ]\n\n```\n\n### Altering Time Series data Stored in Redis\n\nRedisTimeSeries includes commands that can update values in a time series data structure.\n\nUsing the [`TS.ALTER`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.alter/) command, we can update time series retention like this:\n\n```javascript\n\n  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.alter/\n  const alterResponse = await client.ts.alter('temperature', {\n    RETENTION: 0 // Keep the entries forever\n  });\n\n```\n\n### Retrieving Information about the timeseries Stored in Redis\n\nRedisTimeSeries also includes commands that can help to view the information on the state of a time series.\n\nUsing the [`TS.INFO`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.info/) command, we can view timeseries information like this:\n\n```javascript\n\n // Get some information about the state of the timeseries.\n  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.info/\n  const tsInfo = await client.ts.info('temperature');\n\n  // tsInfo looks like this:\n  // {\n  //   totalSamples: 1440,\n  //   memoryUsage: 28904,\n  //   firstTimestamp: 1641508920000,\n  //   lastTimestamp: 1641595320000,\n  //   retentionTime: 86400000,\n  //   chunkCount: 7,\n  //   chunkSize: 4096,\n  //   chunkType: 'uncompressed',\n  //   duplicatePolicy: 'block',\n  //   labels: [],\n  //   sourceKey: null,\n  //   rules: []\n  // }\n\n```",

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\r\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\r\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\r\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\n\r\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\r\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\r\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\r\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\r\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\r\n     categorized.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\r\n     under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  i.

License grant.\r\n\r\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\r\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\r\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\n\r\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\r\n               in part; and\r\n\r\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\r\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\r\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\r\n          its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\r\n          6(a).\r\n\r\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\r\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\r\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\r\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\r\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\r\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\r\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\r\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\r\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\r\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       5. Downstream recipients.\r\n\r\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\r\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\r\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\r\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\r\n               Public License.\r\n\r\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n\r\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\r\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\r\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\r\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\r\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\r\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\n  b. Other rights.\r\n\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\r\n          Public License.\r\n\r\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\r\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\r\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\r\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\r\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\r\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\r\nfollowing conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. Attribution.\r\n\r\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\r\n          form), You must:\r\n\r\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\r\n               with the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\r\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\r\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\r\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\r\n                    designated);\r\n\r\n                ii. a copyright notice;\r\n\r\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\r\n\r\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\r\n                    warranties;\r\n\r\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\r\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\r\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\n\r\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\r\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\r\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\r\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\r\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\r\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\r\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\r\n          information.\r\n\r\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\r\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\r\n          reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\r\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\r\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\r\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\r\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\r\n     portion of the contents of the database;\r\n\r\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\r\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\n\r\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\r\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\r\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\r\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\r\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\r\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\r\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\r\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\r\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\r\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\r\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\r\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\r\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\r\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\r\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\r\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\r\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\r\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\r\n     waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\r\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\r\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\r\n     terminate automatically.\r\n\r\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\r\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\r\n          violation; or\r\n\r\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\r\n     of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\r\n     will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\r\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\n\r\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\r\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\r\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\r\n\r\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\r\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\r\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\r\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\r\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\r\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\r\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\r\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\r\n     Licensor.\r\n\r\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\r\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\r\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\r\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\r\nlicenses.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

In case of array, it will create a new element for each item named as parent element without the last symbol e.g. `cars` -> `car` items  or with a name defined in a config parameter `singulars`: `people: 'person'`.\n\n## How to install\n```\nnpm install another-json-xml --save\n```\n\n# How to use\n```\nconst { json2xml } = require('another-json-xml');\n\nconst json = {\n  \"name\": \"John\",\n  \"age\": 30,\n  \"cars\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ford\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"BMW\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"Fiat\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nconst xml = json2xml(json);\n```\n\nresult\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<root>\n\t<name>John</name>\n\t<age>30</age>\n\t<cars>\n\t\t<car>\n\t\t\t<name>Ford</name>\n\t\t</car>\n\t\t<car>\n\t\t\t<name>BMW</name>\n\t\t</car>\n\t\t<car>\n\t\t\t<name>Fiat</name>\n\t\t</car>\n\t</cars>\n</root>\n```\n\n# Config (optional)\n\nYou can pass config object as a second parameter to `json2xml` function e.g.\n```\nconst xml = json2xml(json, config);\n```\n\nOr wrap it in a function for a shared config settings and use as a function e.g.\n```\nconst { getConfiguredJson2Xml } = require('another-json-xml');\n\nconst json2xml = getConfiguredJson2Xml({\n  root: 'root',\n  indent: '\\t',\n  exclude: [],\n  minify: false,\n  singulars: {},\n});\n\nconst xml = json2xml(json);\nconsole.log(xml);\n```\n\nDefault config is:\n\n```\nconst config = {\n  root: 'root',\n  indent: '\\t',\n  exclude: [],\n  minify: false,\n  singulars: {},\n  declaration: '<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>'\n}\n```\n\n- `root` - root element name, default value is `'root'`\n- `indent` - indent string, default is `'\\t'`\n- `exclude` - array of keys that should be ignored e.g. `['_id']`, default is []\n- `minify` - minify xml, default is `false`, in case it is true `indent` will be ignored\n- `singulars` - dictionary for list elements, default is {} and be default in case of `cars` it will be `car` (removes last symbol from the key name)\n- `declaration` - add xml declaration, default is `<\\?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"\\?>`\n\ne.g.\n\n```\nconst config = {\n  root: 'secret-data',\n  indent: '    ',\n  exclude: ['age', 'salary', 'password'],\n  minify: false,\n  singulars: {\n    people: 'person'\n  }\n}",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n```javascript\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n```\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Trademarks.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Effective Date\n\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\n     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\n     such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n        Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\n     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\n     under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\n     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\n     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0.

        "licenseTxt": "Command-Line Parser With Readable Syntax From Your Sweetest Dreams\n==================================================================\n\nEver wrote crap code to deal with parsing command-line options? No more. Here's how it should look like (in CoffeeScript):\n\n    options = require('dreamopt') [\n      \"Usage: myscript [options] <source> [<destination>]\"\n\n      \"  <source>           Source file to compile into css #required\"\n      \"  <destination>      Destination file (defaults to source file with .css extension)\", (value, options) ->\n        if !value\n          return options.source.replace(/\\.mess/, '') + '.css'\n\n      \"Processing options:\"\n      \"  -n, --dry-run    Don't write anything to disk\"\n      \"  -m, --mode MODE  Set execution mode: easy, medium, hard (defaults to medium)\"\n\n      \"Connection options:\"\n      \"  -p, --port PORT  Port to connect to (default: 80)\"\n      \"  -h, --host HOST  Host to connect to (default is localhost)\"\n\n      \"Getting useful information:\"\n      \"  --reporters      Print a list of reporters and exit\", ->\n        console.log \"Reporters: foo, bar, boz\"\n        process.exit 0\n    ]\n\n    console.log JSON.stringify(options, null, 2)\n\nTry to run it as `node examples/foo.js`:\n\n    Error: Missing required argument #1: source\n\nNow run it as `node examples/foo.js myfile.mess`:\n\n    {\n      \"mode\": \"medium\",\n      \"port\": 80,\n      \"host\": \"localhost\",\n      \"source\": \"myfile.mess\",\n      \"destination\": \"myfile.css\",\n      \"argv\": [\n        \"myfile.mess\",\n        \"myfile.css\"\n      ]\n    }\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    npm install dreamopt\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nOverview:\n\n* readable option specification with no extra punctuation\n* comprehensive test suite (221 tests so far)\n* returns a simple hash with predicable contents and coerced data types\n* mandatory and optional arguments/options\n* commands, subcommands, subsubcommands, with command-specific options and per-command help/usage\n* default values\n* optional callback functions\n* custom tags and coercion rules\n* automatic `--help`\n\nOption syntax details:\n\n* long options always start with double dashes (`--long`), short options with a single dash (`-s`)\n* a single dash by itself (`-`) is considered a positional argument rather than an option (and usually signifies reading from stdin)\n* `--` ends option processing\n* option value can be specified as `-sVAL`, `-s VAL`, `--long=VAL` or `--long VAL`\n* short options can be combined (`-xc`)\n* short option that requires a value consumes the remainder of the combined option if any (`-xcfMYFILE`, `-pi.tmp`)\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThis module can called with up to three arguments:\n\n    options = require('dreamopt')(spec, [options])\n\nwhere:\n\n* `spec` is a required array of strings\n* `options` is an optional hash (i.e. a JavaScript object)\n\nThe following options can be specified:\n\n* `options.argv` is an array of command-line arguments, defaults to `process.argv.slice(2)`\n* `options.customTags` is a hash with custom tag handlers\n* `options.error(err)` is a function that handles syntax error, the default one prints `err.message` and exits\n* `options.help(usage)` is a function that handles `--help`, the default one prints `usage` and exits\n* `options.loadCommandSyntax(command)` is a function that returns the subcommand syntax for the given command\n\n\nSpecification format\n--------------------\n\nEach line of `spec` can be:\n\n* `Usage: blah blag` — a banner, it is displayed at the very top of the usage info\n* `Something:` — a header, it is displayed verbatim with appropriate spacing; if you don't define any headers, dreamopt will add the default ones as needed (“Arguments:” and “Options:”)\n* `-s, --long <value>  Description #tag1 #tag2(val2)` — option definition; must start with at least one space; if description or tags are specified, they must be separated from the option itself by at least two spaces; tags must be in the end and may have optional values\n* `-s, --long VALUE  Description #tag1 #tag2(val2)` — can use `VALUE` instead of `<value>`\n* `<arg>  Description #tag1 #tag2` — positional argument definition, same format as options\n* `ARG  Description #tag1 #tag2` — can use `ARG` instead of `<arg>`\n* after an option or an argument, you can include a function to be invoked when the option/argument is encountered\n* `command  Description` followed by a handler function (optional) and an array (required unless you provide `options.loadCommandSyntax`) — subcommand definition\n\nAny other lines that don't start with whitespace are output verbatim, as a paragraph of text. (Lines that start with whitespace must conform to option, argument or subcommand syntax.)\n\n\nCommands\n--------\n\nSyntax:\n\n    options = require('dreamopt') [\n      \"Commands:\"\n      \"  init             Create a new repository in the current folder\", []\n      \"  commit           Commit the staged changes\", []\n\n      \"Common options:\"\n      \"  -v, --verbose    Print tons of useless info\"\n    ]\n\n    switch options.command\n      when 'init'\n        ...\n      when 'commit'\n        ...\n\nYou can specify a function to run for each command:\n\n    doInit = (options) ->\n      ...\n\n    doCommit = (options) ->\n      ...\n\n    options = require('dreamopt') [\n      \"Commands:\"\n      \"  init             Create a new repository in the current folder\", [], doInit\n      \"  commit           Commit the staged changes\", [], doCommit\n    ]\n\nCommand-specific options and help:\n\n    INIT_SYNTAX = [\n      \"Create a new repository in the current folder.\"\n\n      \"  -b, --bare     Create a bare repository\"\n    ]\n\n    COMMIT_SYNTAX = [\n      \"Commit the staged changes.\"\n\n      \"Usage: git commit [options] [<file>...]\"\n\n      \"  -a, --all      Auto-add all changes\"\n      \"<file>           The file to commit #list\"\n    ]\n\n    options = require('dreamopt') [\n      \"Commands:\"\n      \"  init\", doInit, INIT_SYNTAX\n      \"  commit\", doCommit, COMMIT_SYNTAX\n\n      \"Common options:\"\n      \"  -v, --verbose    Print tons of useless info\"\n    ]\n\nModularizing your code:\n\n    # main.coffee:\n    options = require('dreamopt') [\n      \"Commands:\n      \"  init\"\n      \"  commit\"\n\n      \"Common options:\"\n      \"  -v, --verbose    Print tons of useless info\"\n    ], {\n      loadCommandSyntax: (command) -> require(\"./commands/#{command}\").usage\n    }\n\n    require(\"./commands/#{options.command}\").run(options)\n\n    # commands/commit.coffee:\n    exports.usage = [\n      \"Commit the staged changes.\"\n\n      \"Usage: git commit [options] [<file>...]\"\n\n      \"  -a, --all      Auto-add all changes\"\n      \"<file>           The file to commit #list\"\n    ]\n\n    exports.run = (options) ->\n      ...\n\nCommands can be nested, which results in `options.command`, `options.subcommand`, `options.subsubcommand` etc; loadCommandSyntax is called with a space-separated command name for nested commands.\n\n\nCoercion, validation and custom tags\n------------------------------------\n\nArgument values are automatically coerced to numbers if possible, otherwise they are provided as strings. You can specify one of the following tags to change coercion rules:\n\n* `#string` disables coercion and always returns a string\n* `#int` always coerces to int, giving an error if that's impossible\n\nYou can define custom tags to handle coercion, validation or any other processing. For example, to parse a simple YYYY-MM-DD date format, you can do:\n\n    options = require('../lib/dreamopt') [\n      \"-f, --from DATE  Only process records from the given date #date\"\n    ], {\n      date: (value, options, optionName) ->\n        if isNaN(new Date(value))\n          throw new Error(\"Invalid date for option #{optionName}\")\n        new Date(value)\n    }\n\n    console.log \"Year: \" + options.from?.getFullYear()\n\nTag functions are invoked with four arguments `(value, options, optionName, tagValue)`:\n\n* `value` is the value of the current option\n* `options` is the options hash built so far\n* `optionName` is useful when referring to the current option in an error message\n* `tagValue` is the value of the tag if any; for example, for `#date(today)` the tagValue would be `'today'`\n\n\nMagic tags\n----------\n\n* `#required` marks a required option or argument\n* `#var(fieldName)` overrides the options field for this option (i.e. the value is stored into `options.fieldName`)\n* `#default(value)` specifies a default value\n* `#list` marks an option that may be used multiple times; the final value is a JavaScript array\n* `#fancydefault` forces the callback function associated with the current option to be called even when an argument is not provided and no default is set; in this case, the original value will be `null` and your function is expected to return a better one\n* `#delayfunc` delays invocation of the callback function until all other options and arguments are processed; this is useful for options like `--help` or `--print-reporters`, when you want all normal options to be handled and validated before the callback is invoked; the return value of such callback functions is ignored\n\nAdditionally, you may encounter the following internal tags in the source code:\n\n* `#flag` denotes a no-values option (which is always treated as boolean)\n* `#acceptsno` is set for options which use `--[no-]something` in their definition; all boolean option accept --no-option variant to turn them off, but only options explicitly specified as such are documented as accepting --no variants in usage info\n\n\nAutomatic usage info\n--------------------\n\nIf you don't define a `--help` option, it is provided for you automatically and prints a usage info like this:\n\n    Usage: myscript [options] <source.mess> [<destination.css>]\n\n    Arguments:\n      <source>              Source file to compile into css\n      <destination>         Destination file (defaults to source file with .css extension)\n\n    Processing options:\n      -n, --dry-run         Don't write anything to disk\n      -m, --mode MODE       Set execution mode: easy, medium, hard (defaults to medium)\n\n    Connection options:\n      -p, --port PORT       Port to connect to (default: 80)\n      -h, --host HOST       Host to connect to (default is localhost)\n\n    Getting useful information:\n          --reporters       Print a list of reporters and exit\n      -h, --help            Display this usage information\n\nYou can provide `options.help(usageText)` function to customize the way this usage info is printed; the default implementation outputs the argument via `process.stdout.write` and executes `process.exit(0)`.",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Can be used to reuse or throttle usage of expensive resources such as database connections.\n\n\n\n**V3 upgrade warning**\n\nVersion 3 contains many breaking changes. The differences are mostly minor and I hope easy to accommodate. There is a very rough and basic [upgrade guide](https://gist.github.com/sandfox/5ca20648b60a0cb959638c0cd6fcd02d) I've written, improvements and other attempts most welcome.\n\nIf you are after the older version 2 of this library you should look at the [current github branch](https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool/tree/v2.5) for it.\n\n\n## History\n\nThe history has been moved to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install generic-pool [--save]\n```\n\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example using a fictional generic database driver that doesn't implement any pooling whatsoever itself.\n\n```js\nconst genericPool = require(\"generic-pool\");\nconst DbDriver = require(\"some-db-driver\");\n\n/**\n * Step 1 - Create pool using a factory object\n */\nconst factory = {\n  create: function() {\n    return DbDriver.createClient();\n  },\n  destroy: function(client) {\n    client.disconnect();\n  }\n};\n\nconst opts = {\n  max: 10, // maximum size of the pool\n  min: 2 // minimum size of the pool\n};\n\nconst myPool = genericPool.createPool(factory, opts);\n\n/**\n * Step 2 - Use pool in your code to acquire/release resources\n */\n\n// acquire connection - Promise is resolved\n// once a resource becomes available\nconst resourcePromise = myPool.acquire();\n\nresourcePromise\n  .then(function(client) {\n    client.query(\"select * from foo\", [], function() {\n      // return object back to pool\n      myPool.release(client);\n    });\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    // handle error - this is generally a timeout or maxWaitingClients\n    // error\n  });\n\n/**\n * Step 3 - Drain pool during shutdown (optional)\n */\n// Only call this once in your application -- at the point you want\n// to shutdown and stop using this pool.\nmyPool.drain().then(function() {\n  myPool.clear();\n});\n\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n\n\n### Creating a pool\n\nWhilst it is possible to directly instantiate the Pool class directly, it is recommended to use the `createPool` function exported by module as the constructor method signature may change in the future.\n\n### createPool\n\nThe createPool function takes two arguments:\n\n- `factory` :  an object containing functions to create/destroy/test resources for the `Pool`\n- `opts` : an optional object/dictonary to allow configuring/altering behaviour of the `Pool`\n\n```js\nconst genericPool = require('generic-pool')\nconst pool = genericPool.createPool(factory, opts)\n```\n\n**factory**\n\nCan be any object/instance but must have the following properties:\n\n- `create` : a function that the pool will call when it wants a new resource. It should return a Promise that either resolves to a `resource` or rejects to an `Error` if it is unable to create a resource for whatever reason.\n- `destroy`: a function that the pool will call when it wants to destroy a resource. It should accept one argument `resource` where `resource` is whatever `factory.create` made. The `destroy` function should return a `Promise` that resolves once it has destroyed the resource.\n\n\noptionally it can also have the following property:\n\n- `validate`: a function that the pool will call if it wants to validate a resource. It should accept one argument `resource` where `resource` is whatever `factory.create` made. Should return a `Promise` that resolves a `boolean` where `true` indicates the resource is still valid or `false` if the resource is invalid.\n\n_Note: The values returned from `create`, `destroy`, and `validate` are all wrapped in a `Promise.resolve` by the pool before being used internally._\n\n**opts**\n\nAn optional object/dictionary with the any of the following properties:\n\n- `max`: maximum number of resources to create at any given time. (default=1)\n- `min`: minimum number of resources to keep in pool at any given time. If this is set >= max, the pool will silently set the min to equal `max`. (default=0)\n- `maxWaitingClients`: maximum number of queued requests allowed, additional `acquire` calls will be callback with an `err` in a future cycle of the event loop.\n- `testOnBorrow`: `boolean`: should the pool validate resources before giving them to clients. Requires that `factory.validate` is specified.\n- `acquireTimeoutMillis`: max milliseconds an `acquire` call will wait for a resource before timing out. (default no limit), if supplied should non-zero positive integer.\n- `destroyTimeoutMillis`: max milliseconds a `destroy` call will wait for a resource before timing out. (default no limit), if supplied should non-zero positive integer.\n- `fifo` : if true the oldest resources will be first to be allocated. If false the most recently released resources will be the first to be allocated. This in effect turns the pool's behaviour from a queue into a stack. `boolean`, (default true)\n- `priorityRange`: int between 1 and x - if set, borrowers can specify their relative priority in the queue if no resources are available.\n                         see example.  (default 1)\n- `autostart`: boolean, should the pool start creating resources, initialize the evictor, etc once the constructor is called. If false, the pool can be started by calling `pool.start`, otherwise the first call to `acquire` will start the pool. (default true)\n- `evictionRunIntervalMillis`: How often to run eviction checks. Default: 0 (does not run).\n- `numTestsPerEvictionRun`: Number of resources to check each eviction run.  Default: 3.\n- `softIdleTimeoutMillis`: amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle object evictor (if any), with the extra condition that at least \"min idle\" object instances remain in the pool. Default -1 (nothing can get evicted)\n- `idleTimeoutMillis`: the minimum amount of time that an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction due to idle time. Supercedes `softIdleTimeoutMillis` Default: 30000\n- `Promise`: Promise lib, a Promises/A+ implementation that the pool should use. Defaults to whatever `global.Promise` is (usually native promises).\n\n### pool.acquire\n\n```js\nconst onfulfilled = function(resource){\n\tresource.doStuff()\n\t// release/destroy/etc\n}\n\npool.acquire().then(onfulfilled)\n//or\nconst priority = 2\npool.acquire(priority).then(onfulfilled)\n```\n\nThis function is for when you want to \"borrow\" a resource from the pool.\n\n`acquire` takes one optional argument:\n\n- `priority`: optional, number, see **Priority Queueing** below.\n\nand returns a `Promise`\nOnce a resource in the pool is available, the promise will be resolved with a `resource` (whatever `factory.create` makes for you). If the Pool is unable to give a resource (e.g timeout) then the promise will be rejected with an `Error`\n\n### pool.release\n\n```js\npool.release(resource)\n```\n\nThis function is for when you want to return a resource to the pool.\n\n`release` takes one required argument:\n\n- `resource`: a previously borrowed resource\n\nand returns a `Promise`. This promise will resolve once the `resource` is accepted by the pool, or reject if the pool is unable to accept the `resource` for any reason (e.g `resource` is not a resource or object that came from the pool). If you do not care the outcome it is safe to ignore this promise.\n\n### pool.isBorrowedResource\n\n```js\npool.isBorrowedResource(resource)\n```\n\nThis function is for when you need to check if a resource has been acquired from the pool and not yet released/destroyed.\n\n`isBorrowedResource` takes one required argument:\n\n- `resource`: any object which you need to test\n\nand returns true (primitive, not Promise) if resource is currently borrowed from the pool, false otherwise.\n\n### pool.destroy\n\n```js\npool.destroy(resource)\n```\n\nThis function is for when you want to return a resource to the pool but want it destroyed rather than being made available to other resources. E.g you may know the resource has timed out or crashed.\n\n`destroy` takes one required argument:\n\n- `resource`: a previously borrowed resource\n\nand returns a `Promise`. This promise will resolve once the `resource` is accepted by the pool, or reject if the pool is unable to accept the `resource` for any reason (e.g `resource` is not a resource or object that came from the pool). If you do not care the outcome it is safe to ignore this promise.\n\n### pool.on\n\n```js\npool.on('factoryCreateError', function(err){\n  //log stuff maybe\n})\n\npool.on('factoryDestroyError', function(err){\n  //log stuff maybe\n})\n```\n\nThe pool is an event emitter. Below are the events it emits and any args for those events\n\n- `factoryCreateError` : emitted when a promise returned by `factory.create` is rejected. If this event has no listeners then the `error` will be silently discarded\n  - `error`: whatever `reason` the promise was rejected with.\n\n- `factoryDestroyError` : emitted when a promise returned by `factory.destroy` is rejected. If this event has no listeners then the `error` will be silently discarded\n  - `error`: whatever `reason` the promise was rejected with.\n\n### pool.start\n\n```js\npool.start()\n```\n\nIf `autostart` is `false` then this method can be used to start the pool and therefore begin creation of resources, start the evictor, and any other internal logic.\n\n### pool.ready\n\n```js\npool.ready()\n```\n\nWaits for the pool to fully start.\n\n### pool.use\n\n```js\n\nconst myTask = dbClient => {\n  return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {\n    // do something with the client and resolve/reject\n    })\n}\n\npool.use(myTask).then(/* a promise that will run after myTask resolves */)\n```\n\nThis method handles acquiring a `resource` from the pool, handing it to your function and then calling `pool.release` or `pool.destroy` with resource after your function has finished.\n\n`use` takes one required argument:\n\n- `fn`: a function that accepts a `resource` and returns a `Promise`. Once that promise `resolve`s the `resource` is returned to the pool, else if it `reject`s then the resource is destroyed.\n- `priority`: Optionally, you can specify the priority as number. See [Priority Queueing](#priority-queueing) section.\n\nand returns a `Promise` that either `resolve`s with the value from the user supplied `fn` or `reject`s with an error.\n\n## Idle Object Eviction\n\nThe pool has an evictor (off by default) which will inspect idle items in the pool and `destroy` them if they are too old.\n\nBy default the evictor does not run, to enable it you must set the `evictionRunIntervalMillis` option to a non-zero value. Once enable the evictor will check at most `numTestsPerEvictionRun` each time, this is to stop it blocking your application if you have lots of resources in the pool.\n\n\n## Priority Queueing\n\nThe pool supports optional priority queueing.  This becomes relevant when no resources are available and the caller has to wait. `acquire()` accepts an optional priority int which\nspecifies the caller's relative position in the queue. Each priority slot has it's own internal queue created for it. When a resource is available for borrowing, the first request in the highest priority queue will be given it.\n\nSpecifying a `priority` to `acquire` that is outside the `priorityRange` set at `Pool` creation time will result in the `priority` being converted the lowest possible `priority`\n\n```js\n// create pool with priorityRange of 3\n// borrowers can specify a priority 0 to 2\nconst opts = {\n  priorityRange : 3\n}\nconst pool = genericPool.createPool(someFactory,opts);\n\n// acquire connection - no priority specified - will go onto lowest priority queue\npool.acquire().then(function(client) {\n    pool.release(client);\n});\n\n// acquire connection - high priority - will go into highest priority queue\npool.acquire(0).then(function(client) {\n    pool.release(client);\n});\n\n// acquire connection - medium priority - will go into 'mid' priority queue\npool.acquire(1).then(function(client) {\n    pool.release(client);\n});\n\n// etc..\n```\n\n## Draining\n\nIf you are shutting down a long-lived process, you may notice\nthat node fails to exit for 30 seconds or so.  This is a side\neffect of the idleTimeoutMillis behavior -- the pool has a\nsetTimeout() call registered that is in the event loop queue, so\nnode won't terminate until all resources have timed out, and the pool\nstops trying to manage them.\n\nThis behavior will be more problematic when you set factory.min > 0,\nas the pool will never become empty, and the setTimeout calls will\nnever end.\n\nIn these cases, use the pool.drain() function.  This sets the pool\ninto a \"draining\" state which will gracefully wait until all\nidle resources have timed out.  For example, you can call:\n\nIf you do this, your node process will exit gracefully.\n\nIf you know you would like to terminate all the available resources in your pool before any timeouts they might have are reached, you can use `clear()` in conjunction with `drain()`:\n\n```js\nconst p = pool.drain()\n.then(function() {\n    return pool.clear();\n});\n```\nThe `promise` returned will resolve once all waiting clients have acquired and return resources, and any available resources have been destroyed\n\nOne side-effect of calling `drain()` is that subsequent calls to `acquire()`\nwill throw an Error.\n\n## Pooled function decoration\n\nThis has now been extracted out it's own module [generic-pool-decorator](https://github.com/sandfox/generic-pool-decorator)\n\n## Pool info\n\nThe following properties will let you get information about the pool:\n\n```js\n\n// How many many more resources can the pool manage/create\npool.spareResourceCapacity\n\n// returns number of resources in the pool regardless of\n// whether they are free or in use\npool.size\n\n// returns number of unused resources in the pool\npool.available\n\n// number of resources that are currently acquired by userland code\npool.borrowed\n\n// returns number of callers waiting to acquire a resource\npool.pending\n\n// returns number of maxixmum number of resources allowed by pool\npool.max\n\n// returns number of minimum number of resources allowed by pool\npool.min\n\n```\n\n## Run Tests\n\n    $ npm install\n    $ npm test\n\nThe tests are run/written using Tap. Most are ports from the old espresso tests and are not in great condition. Most cases are inside `test/generic-pool-test.js` with newer cases in their own files (legacy reasons).\n\n## Linting\n\nWe use eslint combined with prettier\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2016 James Cooper &lt;james@bitmechanic.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

For the purposes\r\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\r\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\r\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\r\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\r\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\r\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\r\n      the copyright owner.

The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If the\nterms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\nmake of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\na different licensing arrangement.\n\nDefinitions\n\n    \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\n    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n\n    \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n    procedures.\n\n    \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\n    distribute, or modify the Package.\n\n    \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\n    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\n    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\n    Version, or a Modified Version.\n\n    \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\n    \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n    this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n    by the Copyright Holder.\n\n    \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n    Holder.\n\n    \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n    \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n    configuration files for the Package.\n\n    \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n    translation of the Source form.\n\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\n(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\nCompiled form of the Package.\n\n(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\nwill be subject to the Original License.\n\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n    Version.\n\n    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n    from the name of the Standard Version.\n\n    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n    under\n\n        (i)  the Original License or\n\n        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n        Fees are allowed.\n\n\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\nor Modified Versions without the Source\n\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\nget the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\nvalid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\ntime while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\nmust provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\nIf you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\ndays after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\nyou do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\nthe Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\nthe Source of the Modified Version.\n\n\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n\n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\nModified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\naggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\nPackage.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\nas included in the aggregation.\n\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\nthe Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\nterms of this license.\n\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\nlicense.\n\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\nthis license.\n\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\ndate that such litigation is filed.\n\n(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\nNON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\nLAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL\nBE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n\n\n--------",

Options in the object will override any present in the url. Options will fall back to the same environment variables as psql.\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres('postgres://username:password@host:port/database', {\n  host                 : '',            // Postgres ip address[s] or domain name[s]\n  port                 : 5432,          // Postgres server port[s]\n  database             : '',            // Name of database to connect to\n  username             : '',            // Username of database user\n  password             : '',            // Password of database user\n  ...and more\n})\n```\n\nMore options can be found in the [Connection details section](#connection-details).\n\n## Queries\n\n### ```await sql`...` -> Result[]```\n\nPostgres.js utilizes [Tagged template functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates) to process query parameters **before** interpolation. Using tagged template literals benefits developers by:\n\n1. **Enforcing** safe query generation\n2. Giving the ` sql`` ` function powerful [utility](#dynamic-inserts) and [query building](#building-queries) features.\n\nAny generic value will be serialized according to an inferred type, and replaced by a PostgreSQL protocol placeholder `$1, $2, ...`. The parameters are then sent separately to the database which handles escaping & casting.\n\nAll queries will return a `Result` array, with objects mapping column names to each row.\n\n```js\nconst xs = await sql`\n  insert into users (\n    name, age\n  ) values (\n    'Murray', 68\n  )\n\n  returning *\n`\n\n// xs = [{ user_id: 1, name: 'Murray', age: 68 }]\n```\n\n> Please note that queries are first executed when `awaited` – or instantly by using [`.execute()`](#execute).\n\n### Query parameters\n\nParameters are automatically extracted and handled by the database so that SQL injection isn't possible. No special handling is necessary, simply use tagged template literals as usual.\n\n```js\nconst name = 'Mur'\n    , age = 60\n\nconst users = await sql`\n  select\n    name,\n    age\n  from users\n  where\n    name like ${ name + '%' }\n    and age > ${ age }\n`\n// users = [{ name: 'Murray', age: 68 }]\n```\n\n> Be careful with quotation marks here. Because Postgres infers column types, you do not need to wrap your interpolated parameters in quotes like `'${name}'`. This will cause an error because the tagged template replaces `${name}` with `$1` in the query string, leaving Postgres to do the interpolation. If you wrap that in a string, Postgres will see `'$1'` and interpret it as a string as opposed to a parameter.\n\n### Dynamic column selection\n\n```js\nconst columns = ['name', 'age']\n\nawait sql`\n  select\n    ${ sql(columns) }\n  from users\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nselect \"name\", \"age\" from users\n```\n\n### Dynamic inserts\n\n```js\nconst user = {\n  name: 'Murray',\n  age: 68\n}\n\nawait sql`\n  insert into users ${\n    sql(user, 'name', 'age')\n  }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\ninsert into users (\"name\", \"age\") values ($1, $2)\n\n// The columns can also be given with an array\nconst columns = ['name', 'age']\n\nawait sql`\n  insert into users ${\n    sql(user, columns)\n  }\n`\n```\n\n**You can omit column names and simply execute `sql(user)` to get all the fields from the object as columns**. Be careful not to allow users to supply columns that you do not want to be inserted.\n\n#### Multiple inserts in one query\nIf you need to insert multiple rows at the same time it's also much faster to do it with a single `insert`. Simply pass an array of objects to `sql()`.\n\n```js\nconst users = [{\n  name: 'Murray',\n  age: 68,\n  garbage: 'ignore'\n},\n{\n  name: 'Walter',\n  age: 80\n}]\n\nawait sql`insert into users ${ sql(users, 'name', 'age') }`\n\n// Is translated to:\ninsert into users (\"name\", \"age\") values ($1, $2), ($3, $4)\n\n// Here you can also omit column names which will use object keys as columns\nawait sql`insert into users ${ sql(users) }`\n\n// Which results in:\ninsert into users (\"name\", \"age\") values ($1, $2), ($3, $4)\n```\n\n### Dynamic columns in updates\nThis is also useful for update queries\n```js\nconst user = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'Murray',\n  age: 68\n}\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set ${\n    sql(user, 'name', 'age')\n  }\n  where user_id = ${ user.id }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nupdate users set \"name\" = $1, \"age\" = $2 where user_id = $3\n\n// The columns can also be given with an array\nconst columns = ['name', 'age']\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set ${\n    sql(user, columns)\n  }\n  where user_id = ${ user.id }\n`\n```\n\n### Multiple updates in one query\nTo create multiple updates in a single query, it is necessary to use arrays instead of objects to ensure that the order of the items correspond with the column names.\n```js\nconst users = [\n  [1, 'John', 34],\n  [2, 'Jane', 27],\n]\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set name = update_data.name, age = (update_data.age)::int\n  from (values ${sql(users)}) as update_data (id, name, age)\n  where users.id = (update_data.id)::int\n  returning users.id, users.name, users.age\n`\n```\n\n### Dynamic values and `where in`\nValue lists can also be created dynamically, making `where in` queries simple too.\n```js\nconst users = await sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from users\n  where age in ${ sql([68, 75, 23]) }\n`\n```\n\nor\n```js\nconst [{ a, b, c }] = await sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from (values ${ sql(['a', 'b', 'c']) }) as x(a, b, c)\n`\n```\n\n## Building queries\n\nPostgres.js features a simple dynamic query builder by conditionally appending/omitting query fragments.\nIt works by nesting ` sql`` ` fragments within other ` sql`` ` calls or fragments. This allows you to build dynamic queries safely without risking sql injections through usual string concatenation.\n\n### Partial queries\n```js\nconst olderThan = x => sql`and age > ${ x }`\n\nconst filterAge = true\n\nawait sql`\n  select\n   *\n  from users\n  where name is not null ${\n    filterAge\n      ? olderThan(50)\n      : sql``\n  }\n`\n// Which results in:\nselect * from users where name is not null\n// Or\nselect * from users where name is not null and age > 50\n```\n\n### Dynamic filters\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from users ${\n    id\n      ? sql`where user_id = ${ id }`\n      : sql``\n  }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nselect * from users\n// Or\nselect * from users where user_id = $1\n```\n\n### SQL functions\nUsing keywords or calling functions dynamically is also possible by using ``` sql`` ``` fragments.\n```js\nconst date = null\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set updated_at = ${ date || sql`now()` }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nupdate users set updated_at = now()\n```\n\n### Table names\nDynamic identifiers like table names and column names is also supported like so:\n```js\nconst table = 'users'\n    , column = 'id'\n\nawait sql`\n  select ${ sql(column) } from ${ sql(table) }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nselect \"id\" from \"users\"\n```\n\n### Quick primer on interpolation\n\nHere's a quick oversight over all the ways to do interpolation in a query template string:\n\n| Interpolation syntax       | Usage                         | Example                                                   |\n| -------------              | -------------                 | -------------                                             |\n| `${ sql`` }`               | for keywords or sql fragments | ``await sql`SELECT * FROM users ${sql`order by age desc` }` ``  |\n| `${ sql(string) }`         | for identifiers               | ``await sql`SELECT * FROM ${sql('table_name')` ``               |\n| `${ sql([] or {}, ...) }`  | for helpers                   | ``await sql`INSERT INTO users ${sql({ name: 'Peter'})}` ``      |\n| `${ 'somevalue' }`         | for values                    | ``await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = ${42}` ``           |\n\n## Advanced query methods\n\n### Cursors\n\n#### ```await sql``.cursor([rows = 1], [fn])```\n\nUse cursors if you need to throttle the amount of rows being returned from a query. You can use a cursor either as an [async iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) or with a callback function. For a callback function new results won't be requested until the promise / async callback function has resolved.\n\n##### callback function\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from generate_series(1,4) as x\n`.cursor(async([row]) => {\n  // row = { x: 1 }\n  await http.request('https://example.com/wat', { row })\n})\n```\n\n##### for await...of\n```js\n// for await...of\nconst cursor = sql`select * from generate_series(1,4) as x`.cursor()\n\nfor await (const [row] of cursor) {\n  // row = { x: 1 }\n  await http.request('https://example.com/wat', { row })\n}\n```\n\nA single row will be returned by default, but you can also request batches by setting the number of rows desired in each batch as the first argument to `.cursor`:\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from generate_series(1,1000) as x\n`.cursor(10, async rows => {\n  // rows = [{ x: 1 }, { x: 2 }, ... ]\n  await Promise.all(rows.map(row =>\n    http.request('https://example.com/wat', { row })\n  ))\n})\n```\n\nIf an error is thrown inside the callback function no more rows will be requested and the outer promise will reject with the thrown error.\n\nYou can close the cursor early either by calling `break` in the `for await...of` loop, or by returning the token `sql.CLOSE` from the callback function.\n\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select * from generate_series(1,1000) as x\n`.cursor(row => {\n  return Math.random() > 0.9 && sql.CLOSE // or sql.END\n})\n```\n\n### Instant iteration\n\n#### ```await sql``.forEach(fn)```\n\nIf you want to handle rows returned by a query one by one, you can use `.forEach` which returns a promise that resolves once there are no more rows.\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select created_at, name from events\n`.forEach(row => {\n  // row = { created_at: '2019-11-22T14:22:00Z', name: 'connected' }\n})\n\n// No more rows\n```\n\n### Query Descriptions\n#### ```await sql``.describe() -> Result[]```\n\nRather than executing a given query, `.describe` will return information utilized in the query process. This information can include the query identifier, column types, etc.\n\nThis is useful for debugging and analyzing your Postgres queries. Furthermore, **`.describe` will give you access to the final generated query string that would be executed.**\n\n### Rows as Array of Values\n#### ```sql``.values()```\n\nUsing `.values` will return rows as an array of values for each column, instead of objects.\n\nThis can be useful to receive identically named columns, or for specific performance/transformation reasons. The column definitions are still included on the result array, plus access to parsers for each column.\n\n### Rows as Raw Array of Buffers\n#### ```sql``.raw()```\n\nUsing `.raw` will return rows as an array with `Buffer` values for each column, instead of objects.\n\nThis can be useful for specific performance/transformation reasons. The column definitions are still included on the result array, plus access to parsers for each column.\n\n### Queries in Files\n#### `await sql.file(path, [args], [options]) -> Result[]`\n\nUsing a file for a query is also supported with optional parameters to use if the file includes `$1, $2, etc`\n\n```js\nconst result = await sql.file('query.sql', ['Murray', 68])\n```\n\n### Multiple statements in one query\n#### ```await sql``.simple()```\n\nThe postgres wire protocol supports [\"simple\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.6.7.4) and [\"extended\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY) queries. \"simple\" queries supports multiple statements, but does not support any dynamic parameters. \"extended\" queries support parameters but only one statement. To use \"simple\" queries you can use\n```sql``.simple()```. That will create it as a simple query.\n\n```js\nawait sql`select 1; select 2;`.simple()\n```\n\n### Copy to/from as Streams\n\nPostgres.js supports [`COPY ...`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-copy.html) queries, which are exposed as [Node.js streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html).\n\n#### ```await sql`copy ... from stdin`.writable() -> Writable```\n\n```js\nimport { pipeline } from 'node:stream/promises'\n\n// Stream of users with the default tab delimitated cells and new-line delimitated rows\nconst userStream = Readable.from([\n  'Murray\\t68\\n',\n  'Walter\\t80\\n'\n])\n\nconst query = await sql`copy users (name, age) from stdin`.writable()\nawait pipeline(userStream, query);\n```\n\n#### ```await sql`copy ... to stdout`.readable() -> Readable```\n\n##### Using Stream Pipeline\n```js\nimport { pipeline } from 'node:stream/promises'\nimport { createWriteStream } from 'node:fs'\n\nconst readableStream = await sql`copy users (name, age) to stdout`.readable()\nawait pipeline(readableStream, createWriteStream('output.tsv'))\n// output.tsv content: `Murray\\t68\\nWalter\\t80\\n`\n```\n\n##### Using `for await...of`\n```js\nconst readableStream = await sql`\n  copy (\n    select name, age\n    from users\n    where age = 68\n  ) to stdout\n`.readable()\nfor await (const chunk of readableStream) {\n  // chunk.toString() === `Murray\\t68\\n`\n}\n```\n\n> **NOTE** This is a low-level API which does not provide any type safety. To make this work, you must match your [`copy query` parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-copy.html) correctly to your [Node.js stream read or write](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) code. Ensure [Node.js stream backpressure](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/modules/backpressuring-in-streams) is handled correctly to avoid memory exhaustion.\n\n### Canceling Queries in Progress\n\nPostgres.js supports, [canceling queries in progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.1/protocol-protocol.html#AEN39000). It works by opening a new connection with a protocol level startup message to cancel the current query running on a specific connection. That means there is no guarantee that the query will be canceled, and due to the possible race conditions it might even result in canceling another query. This is fine for long running queries, but in the case of high load and fast queries it might be better to simply ignore results instead of canceling.\n\n```js\nconst query = sql`select pg_sleep 100`.execute()\nsetTimeout(() => query.cancel(), 100)\nconst result = await query\n```\n\n### Execute\n\n#### ```await sql``.execute()```\n\nThe lazy Promise implementation in Postgres.js is what allows it to distinguish [Nested Fragments](#building-queries) from the main outer query. This also means that queries are always executed at the earliest in the following tick. If you have a specific need to execute the query in the same tick, you can call `.execute()`\n\n### Unsafe raw string queries\n\n<details>\n<summary>Advanced unsafe use cases</summary>\n\n### `await sql.unsafe(query, [args], [options]) -> Result[]`\n\nIf you know what you're doing, you can use `unsafe` to pass any string you'd like to postgres. Please note that this can lead to SQL injection if you're not careful.\n\n```js\nsql.unsafe('select ' + danger + ' from users where id = ' + dragons)\n```\n\nYou can also nest `sql.unsafe` within a safe `sql` expression.  This is useful if only part of your fraction has unsafe elements.\n\n```js\nconst triggerName = 'friend_created'\nconst triggerFnName = 'on_friend_created'\nconst eventType = 'insert'\nconst schema_name = 'app'\nconst table_name = 'friends'\n\nawait sql`\n  create or replace trigger ${sql(triggerName)}\n  after ${sql.unsafe(eventType)} on ${sql.unsafe(`${schema_name}.${table_name}`)}\n  for each row\n  execute function ${sql(triggerFnName)}()\n`\n\nawait sql`\n  create role friend_service with login password ${sql.unsafe(`'${password}'`)}\n`\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Transactions\n\n#### BEGIN / COMMIT `await sql.begin([options = ''], fn) -> fn()`\n\nUse `sql.begin` to start a new transaction. Postgres.js will reserve a connection for the transaction and supply a scoped `sql` instance for all transaction uses in the callback function. `sql.begin` will resolve with the returned value from the callback function.\n\n`BEGIN` is automatically sent with the optional options, and if anything fails `ROLLBACK` will be called so the connection can be released and execution can continue.\n\n```js\nconst [user, account] = await sql.begin(async sql => {\n  const [user] = await sql`\n    insert into users (\n      name\n    ) values (\n      'Murray'\n    )\n    returning *\n  `\n\n  const [account] = await sql`\n    insert into accounts (\n      user_id\n    ) values (\n      ${ user.user_id }\n    )\n    returning *\n  `\n\n  return [user, account]\n})\n```\n\nDo note that you can often achieve the same result using [`WITH` queries (Common Table Expressions)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html) instead of using transactions.\n\nIt's also possible to pipeline the requests in a transaction if needed by returning an array with queries from the callback function like this:\n\n```js\nconst result = await sql.begin(sql => [\n  sql`update ...`,\n  sql`update ...`,\n  sql`insert ...`\n])\n```\n\n#### SAVEPOINT `await sql.savepoint([name], fn) -> fn()`\n\n```js\nsql.begin('read write', async sql => {\n  const [user] = await sql`\n    insert into users (\n      name\n    ) values (\n      'Murray'\n    )\n  `\n\n  const [account] = (await sql.savepoint(sql =>\n    sql`\n      insert into accounts (\n        user_id\n      ) values (\n        ${ user.user_id }\n      )\n    `\n  ).catch(err => {\n    // Account could not be created. ROLLBACK SAVEPOINT is called because we caught the rejection.\n  })) || []\n\n  return [user, account]\n})\n.then(([user, account]) => {\n  // great success - COMMIT succeeded\n})\n.catch(() => {\n  // not so good - ROLLBACK was called\n})\n```\n\n\n#### PREPARE TRANSACTION `await sql.prepare([name]) -> fn()`\n\nIndicates that the transactions should be prepared using the [`PREPARE TRANSACTION [NAME]`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare-transaction.html) statement\ninstead of being committed.\n\n```js\nsql.begin('read write', async sql => {\n  const [user] = await sql`\n    insert into users (\n      name\n    ) values (\n      'Murray'\n    )\n  `\n\n  await sql.prepare('tx1')\n})\n```\n\n## Data Transformation\n\nPostgres.js allows for transformation of the data passed to or returned from a query by using the `transform` option.\n\nBuilt in transformation functions are:\n\n* For camelCase - `postgres.camel`, `postgres.toCamel`, `postgres.fromCamel`\n* For PascalCase - `postgres.pascal`, `postgres.toPascal`, `postgres.fromPascal`\n* For Kebab-Case - `postgres.kebab`, `postgres.toKebab`, `postgres.fromKebab`\n\nThese built in transformations will only convert to/from snake_case. For example, using `{ transform: postgres.toCamel }` will convert the column names to camelCase only if the column names are in snake_case to begin with. `{ transform: postgres.fromCamel }` will convert camelCase only to snake_case.\n\nBy default, using `postgres.camel`, `postgres.pascal` and `postgres.kebab` will perform a two-way transformation - both the data passed to the query and the data returned by the query will be transformed:\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names to and from camel case\nconst sql = postgres({ transform: postgres.camel })\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS camel_case (a_test INTEGER, b_test TEXT)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO camel_case ${ sql([{ aTest: 1, bTest: 1 }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT ${ sql('aTest', 'bTest') } FROM camel_case`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { aTest: 1, bTest: '1' } ]\n```\n\nTo only perform half of the transformation (eg. only the transformation **to** or **from** camel case), use the other transformation functions:\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names only to camel case\n// (for the results that are returned from the query)\npostgres({ transform: postgres.toCamel })\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS camel_case (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO camel_case ${ sql([{ a_test: 1 }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT a_test FROM camel_case`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { aTest: 1 } ]\n```\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names only from camel case\n// (for interpolated inserts, updates, and selects)\nconst sql = postgres({ transform: postgres.fromCamel })\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS camel_case (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO camel_case ${ sql([{ aTest: 1 }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT ${ sql('aTest') } FROM camel_case`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { a_test: 1 } ]\n```\n\n> Note that Postgres.js does not rewrite the static parts of the tagged template strings. So to transform column names in your queries, the `sql()` helper must be used - eg. `${ sql('columnName') }` as in the examples above.\n\n### Transform `undefined` Values\n\nBy default, Postgres.js will throw the error `UNDEFINED_VALUE: Undefined values are not allowed` when undefined values are passed\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names to and from camel case\nconst sql = postgres({\n  transform: {\n    undefined: null\n  }\n})\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transform_undefined (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO transform_undefined ${ sql([{ a_test: undefined }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT a_test FROM transform_undefined`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { a_test: null } ]\n```\n\nTo combine with the built in transform functions, spread the transform in the `transform` object:\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names to and from camel case\nconst sql = postgres({\n  transform: {\n    ...postgres.camel,\n    undefined: null\n  }\n})\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transform_undefined (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO transform_undefined ${ sql([{ aTest: undefined }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT ${ sql('aTest') } FROM transform_undefined`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { aTest: null } ]\n```\n\n### Custom Transform Functions\n\nTo specify your own transformation functions, you can use the `column`, `value` and `row` options inside of `transform`, each an object possibly including `to` and `from` keys:\n\n* `to`: The function to transform the outgoing query column name to, i.e `SELECT ${ sql('aName') }` to `SELECT a_name` when using `postgres.toCamel`.\n* `from`: The function to transform the incoming query result column name to, see example below.\n\n> Both parameters are optional, if not provided, the default transformation function will be used.\n\n```js\n// Implement your own functions, look at postgres.toCamel, etc\n// as a reference:\n// https://github.com/porsager/postgres/blob/4241824ffd7aa94ffb482e54ca9f585d9d0a4eea/src/types.js#L310-L328\nfunction transformColumnToDatabase() { /* ... */ }\nfunction transformColumnFromDatabase() { /* ... */ }\n\nconst sql = postgres({\n  transform: {\n    column: {\n      to: transformColumnToDatabase,\n      from: transformColumnFromDatabase,\n    },\n    value: { /* ... */ },\n    row: { /* ... */ }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Listen & notify\n\nWhen you call `.listen`, a dedicated connection will be created to ensure that you receive notifications instantly. This connection will be used for any further calls to `.listen`. The connection will automatically reconnect according to a backoff reconnection pattern to not overload the database server.\n\n### Listen `await sql.listen(channel, onnotify, [onlisten]) -> { state }`\n`.listen` takes the channel name, a function to handle each notify, and an optional function to run every time listen is registered and ready (happens on initial connect and reconnects). It returns a promise which resolves once the `LISTEN` query to Postgres completes, or if there is already a listener active.\n\n```js\nawait sql.listen('news', payload => {\n  const json = JSON.parse(payload)\n  console.log(json.this) // logs 'is'\n})\n```\n\nThe optional `onlisten` method is great to use for a very simply queue mechanism:\n\n```js\nawait sql.listen(\n  'jobs',\n  (x) => run(JSON.parse(x)),\n  ( ) => sql`select unfinished_jobs()`.forEach(run)\n)\n\nfunction run(job) {\n  // And here you do the work you please\n}\n```\n### Notify `await sql.notify(channel, payload) -> Result[]`\nNotify can be done as usual in SQL, or by using the `sql.notify` method.\n```js\nsql.notify('news', JSON.stringify({ no: 'this', is: 'news' }))\n```\n\n## Realtime subscribe\n\nPostgres.js implements the logical replication protocol of PostgreSQL to support subscription to real-time updates of `insert`, `update` and `delete` operations.\n\n> **NOTE** To make this work you must [create the proper publications in your database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html), enable logical replication by setting `wal_level = logical` in `postgresql.conf` and connect using either a replication or superuser.\n\n### Quick start\n\n#### Create a publication (eg. in migration)\n```sql\nCREATE PUBLICATION alltables FOR ALL TABLES\n```\n\n#### Subscribe to updates\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({ publications: 'alltables' })\n\nconst { unsubscribe } = await sql.subscribe(\n  'insert:events',\n  (row, { command, relation, key, old }) => {\n    // Callback function for each row change\n    // tell about new event row over eg. websockets or do something else\n  },\n  () => {\n    // Callback on initial connect and potential reconnects\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### Subscribe pattern\n\nYou can subscribe to specific operations, tables, or even rows with primary keys.\n\n#### `operation`      `:` `schema` `.` `table` `=` `primary_key`\n\n**`operation`** is one of ``` * | insert | update | delete ``` and defaults to `*`\n\n**`schema`** defaults to `public`\n\n**`table`** is a specific table name and defaults to `*`\n\n**`primary_key`** can be used to only subscribe to specific rows\n\n### Examples\n\n```js\nsql.subscribe('*',                () => /* everything */ )\nsql.subscribe('insert',           () => /* all inserts */ )\nsql.subscribe('*:users',          () => /* all operations on the public.users table */ )\nsql.subscribe('delete:users',     () => /* all deletes on the public.users table */ )\nsql.subscribe('update:users=1',   () => /* all updates on the users row with a primary key = 1 */ )\n```\n\n## Numbers, bigint, numeric\n\n`Number` in javascript is only able to represent 2<sup>53</sup>-1 safely which means that types in PostgreSQLs like `bigint` and `numeric` won't fit into `Number`.\n\nSince Node.js v10.4 we can use [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) to match the PostgreSQL type `bigint` which is returned for eg. `count(*)`. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with `JSON.stringify` out of the box, so Postgres.js will return it as a string.\n\nIf you want to use `BigInt` you can add this custom type:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({\n  types: {\n    bigint: postgres.BigInt\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThere is currently no guaranteed way to handle `numeric` / `decimal` types in native Javascript. **These [and similar] types will be returned as a `string`**. The best way in this case is to use  [custom types](#custom-types).\n\n## Result Array\n\nThe `Result` Array returned from queries is a custom array allowing for easy destructuring or passing on directly to JSON.stringify or general Array usage. It includes the following properties.\n\n### .count\n\nThe `count` property is the number of affected rows returned by the database. This is useful for insert, update and delete operations to know the number of rows since .length will be 0 in these cases if not using `RETURNING ...`.\n\n### .command\n\nThe `command` run by the query - eg. one of `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`\n\n### .columns\n\nThe `columns` returned by the query useful to determine types, or map to the result values when using `.values()`\n\n```js\n{\n  name  : String,    // Column name,\n  type  : oid,       // PostgreSQL oid column type\n  parser: Function   // The function used by Postgres.js for parsing\n}\n```\n\n### .statement\n\nThe `statement` contains information about the statement implicitly created by Postgres.js.\n\n```js\n{\n  name    : String,  // The auto generated statement name\n  string  : String,  // The actual query string executed\n  types   : [oid],   // An array of oid expected as input parameters\n  columns : [Column] // Array of columns - same as Result.columns\n}\n```\n\n### .state\n\nThis is the state `{ pid, secret }` of the connection that executed the query.\n\n## Connection details\n\n### All Postgres options\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres('postgres://username:password@host:port/database', {\n  host                 : '',            // Postgres ip address[es] or domain name[s]\n  port                 : 5432,          // Postgres server port[s]\n  path                 : '',            // unix socket path (usually '/tmp')\n  database             : '',            // Name of database to connect to\n  username             : '',            // Username of database user\n  password             : '',            // Password of database user\n  ssl                  : false,         // true, prefer, require, tls.connect options\n  max                  : 10,            // Max number of connections\n  max_lifetime         : null,          // Max lifetime in seconds (more info below)\n  idle_timeout         : 0,             // Idle connection timeout in seconds\n  connect_timeout      : 30,            // Connect timeout in seconds\n  prepare              : true,          // Automatic creation of prepared statements\n  types                : [],            // Array of custom types, see more below\n  onnotice             : fn,            // Default console.log, set false to silence NOTICE\n  onparameter          : fn,            // (key, value) when server param change\n  debug                : fn,            // Is called with (connection, query, params, types)\n  socket               : fn,            // fn returning custom socket to use\n  transform            : {\n    undefined          : undefined,     // Transforms undefined values (eg. to null)\n    column             : fn,            // Transforms incoming column names\n    value              : fn,            // Transforms incoming row values\n    row                : fn             // Transforms entire rows\n  },\n  connection           : {\n    application_name   : 'postgres.js', // Default application_name\n    ...                                 // Other connection parameters, see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html\n  },\n  target_session_attrs : null,          // Use 'read-write' with multiple hosts to\n                                        // ensure only connecting to primary\n  fetch_types          : true,          // Automatically fetches types on connect\n                                        // on initial connection.\n})\n```\n\nNote that `max_lifetime = 60 * (30 + Math.random() * 30)` by default. This resolves to an interval between 30 and 60 minutes to optimize for the benefits of prepared statements **and** working nicely with Linux's OOM killer.\n\n### Dynamic passwords\n\nWhen clients need to use alternative authentication schemes such as access tokens or connections to databases with rotating passwords, provide either a synchronous or asynchronous function that will resolve the dynamic password value at connection time.\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres(url, {\n  // Other connection config\n  ...\n  // Password function for the database user\n  password : async () => await signer.getAuthToken(),\n})\n```\n\n### SSL\n\nAlthough [vulnerable to MITM attacks](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/229297/174913), a common configuration for the `ssl` option for some cloud providers is to set `rejectUnauthorized` to `false` (if `NODE_ENV` is `production`):\n\n```js\nconst sql =\n  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\n    ? // \"Unless you're using a Private or Shield Heroku Postgres database, Heroku Postgres does not currently support verifiable certificates\"\n      // https://help.heroku.com/3DELT3RK/why-can-t-my-third-party-utility-connect-to-heroku-postgres-with-ssl\n      postgres({ ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } })\n    : postgres()\n```\n\nFor more information regarding `ssl` with `postgres`, check out the [Node.js documentation for tls](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/tls.html#new-tlstlssocketsocket-options).\n\n\n### Multi-host connections - High Availability (HA)\n\nMultiple connection strings can be passed to `postgres()` in the form of `postgres('postgres://localhost:5432,localhost:5433', ...)`. This works the same as native the `psql` command. Read more at [multiple host URIs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-MULTIPLE-HOSTS).\n\nConnections will be attempted in order of the specified hosts/ports. On a successful connection, all retries will be reset. This ensures that hosts can come up and down seamlessly.\n\nIf you specify `target_session_attrs: 'primary'` or `PGTARGETSESSIONATTRS=primary` Postgres.js will only connect to the primary host, allowing for zero downtime failovers.\n\n### The Connection Pool\n\nConnections are created lazily once a query is created. This means that simply doing const `sql = postgres(...)` won't have any effect other than instantiating a new `sql` instance.\n\n> No connection will be made until a query is made.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres() // no connections are opened\n\nawait sql`...` // one connection is now opened\nawait sql`...` // previous opened connection is reused\n\n// two connections are opened now\nawait Promise.all([\n  sql`...`,\n  sql`...`\n])\n```\n\n> When there are high amount of concurrent queries, `postgres` will open as many connections as needed up until `max` number of connections is reached. By default `max` is 10. This can be changed by setting `max` in the `postgres()` call. Example - `postgres('connectionURL', { max: 20 })`.\n\nThis means that we get a much simpler story for error handling and reconnections. Queries will be sent over the wire immediately on the next available connection in the pool. Connections are automatically taken out of the pool if you start a transaction using `sql.begin()`, and automatically returned to the pool once your transaction is done.\n\nAny query which was already sent over the wire will be rejected if the connection is lost. It'll automatically defer to the error handling you have for that query, and since connections are lazy it'll automatically try to reconnect the next time a query is made. The benefit of this is no weird generic \"onerror\" handler that tries to get things back to normal, and also simpler application code since you don't have to handle errors out of context.\n\nThere are no guarantees about queries executing in order unless using a transaction with `sql.begin()` or setting `max: 1`. Of course doing a series of queries, one awaiting the other will work as expected, but that's just due to the nature of js async/promise handling, so it's not necessary for this library to be concerned with ordering.\n\nSince this library automatically creates prepared statements, it also has a default max lifetime for connections to prevent memory bloat on the database itself. This is a random interval for each connection between 45 and 90 minutes. This allows multiple connections to independently come up and down without affecting the service.\n\n### Connection timeout\n\nBy default, connections will not close until `.end()` is called. However, it may be useful to have them close automatically when:\n\n- re-instantiating multiple ` sql`` ` instances\n- using Postgres.js in a Serverless environment (Lambda, etc.)\n- using Postgres.js with a database service that automatically closes connections after some time (see [`ECONNRESET` issue](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/179))\n\nThis can be done using the `idle_timeout` or `max_lifetime` options. These configuration options specify the number of seconds to wait before automatically closing an idle connection and the maximum time a connection can exist, respectively.\n\nFor example, to close a connection that has either been idle for 20 seconds or existed for more than 30 minutes:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({\n  idle_timeout: 20,\n  max_lifetime: 60 * 30\n})\n```\n\n### Cloudflare Workers support\n\nPostgres.js has built-in support for the [TCP socket API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) in Cloudflare Workers, which is [on-track](https://github.com/wintercg/proposal-sockets-api) to be standardized and adopted in Node.js and other JavaScript runtimes, such as Deno.\n\nYou can use Postgres.js directly in a Worker, or to benefit from connection pooling and query caching, via the [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/learning/connect-to-postgres/#driver-examples) service available to Workers by passing the Hyperdrive `connectionString` when creating a new `postgres` client as follows:\n\n```ts\n// Requires Postgres.js 3.4.0 or later\nimport postgres from 'postgres'\n\ninterface Env {\n    HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;\n}\n\nexport default async fetch(req: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {\n    // The Postgres.js library accepts a connection string directly\n    const sql = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString)\n    const results = await sql`SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10`\n    return Response.json(results)\n}\n```\n\nIn `wrangler.toml` you will need to enable the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to allow Postgres.js to operate in the Workers environment:\n\n```toml\ncompatibility_flags = [\"nodejs_compat\"]\n```\n\n### Auto fetching of array types\n\nPostgres.js will automatically fetch table/array-type information when it first connects to a database.\n\nIf you have revoked access to `pg_catalog` this feature will no longer work and will need to be disabled.\n\nYou can disable this feature by setting `fetch_types` to `false`.\n\n### Environmental variables\n\nIt is also possible to connect to the database without a connection string or any options. Postgres.js will fall back to the common environment variables used by `psql` as in the table below:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres()\n```\n\n| Option            | Environment Variables    |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------ |\n| `host`            | `PGHOST`                 |\n| `port`            | `PGPORT`                 |\n| `database`        | `PGDATABASE`             |\n| `username`        | `PGUSERNAME` or `PGUSER` |\n| `password`        | `PGPASSWORD`             |\n| `idle_timeout`    | `PGIDLE_TIMEOUT`         |\n| `connect_timeout` | `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT`      |\n\n### Prepared statements\n\nPrepared statements will automatically be created for any queries where it can be inferred that the query is static. This can be disabled by using the `prepare: false` option. For instance — this is useful when [using PGBouncer in `transaction mode`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/93#issuecomment-656290493).\n\n## Custom Types\n\nYou can add ergonomic support for custom types, or simply use `sql.typed(value, type)` inline, where type is the PostgreSQL `oid` for the type and the correctly serialized string. _(`oid` values for types can be found in the `pg_catalog.pg_type` table.)_\n\nAdding Query helpers is the cleanest approach which can be done like this:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({\n  types: {\n    rect: {\n      // The pg_types oid to pass to the db along with the serialized value.\n      to        : 1337,\n\n      // An array of pg_types oids to handle when parsing values coming from the db.\n      from      : [1337],\n\n      //Function that transform values before sending them to the db.\n      serialize : ({ x, y, width, height }) => [x, y, width, height],\n\n      // Function that transforms values coming from the db.\n      parse     : ([x, y, width, height]) => { x, y, width, height }\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n// Now you can use sql.typed.rect() as specified above\nconst [custom] = await sql`\n  insert into rectangles (\n    name,\n    rect\n  ) values (\n    'wat',\n    ${ sql.typed.rect({ x: 13, y: 37, width: 42, height: 80 }) }\n  )\n  returning *\n`\n\n// custom = { name: 'wat', rect: { x: 13, y: 37, width: 42, height: 80 } }\n\n```\n\n### Custom socket\n\nEasily do in-process ssh tunneling to your database by providing a custom socket for Postgres.js to use. The function (optionally async) must return a socket-like duplex stream.\n\nHere's a sample using [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2)\n\n```js\nimport ssh2 from 'ssh2'\n\nconst sql = postgres({\n  ...options,\n  socket: ({ host: [host], port: [port] }) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const ssh = new ssh2.Client()\n    ssh\n    .on('error', reject)\n    .on('ready', () =>\n      ssh.forwardOut('127.0.0.1', 12345, host, port,\n        (err, socket) => err ? reject(err) : resolve(socket)\n      )\n    )\n    .connect(sshOptions)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Teardown / Cleanup\n\nTo ensure proper teardown and cleanup on server restarts use `await sql.end()` before `process.exit()`.\n\nCalling `sql.end()` will reject new queries and return a Promise which resolves when all queries are finished and the underlying connections are closed. If a `{ timeout }` option is provided any pending queries will be rejected once the timeout (in seconds) is reached and the connections will be destroyed.\n\n#### Sample shutdown using [Prexit](https://github.com/porsager/prexit)\n\n```js\nimport prexit from 'prexit'\n\nprexit(async () => {\n  await sql.end({ timeout: 5 })\n  await new Promise(r => server.close(r))\n})\n```\n\n## Reserving connections\n\n### `await sql.reserve()`\n\nThe `reserve` method pulls out a connection from the pool, and returns a client that wraps the single connection. This can be used for running queries on an isolated connection.\n\n```ts\nconst reserved = await sql.reserve()\nawait reserved`select * from users`\nawait reserved.release()\n```\n\n### `reserved.release()`\n\nOnce you have finished with the reserved connection, call `release` to add it back to the pool.\n\n## Error handling\n\nErrors are all thrown to related queries and never globally. Errors coming from database itself are always in the [native Postgres format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html), and the same goes for any [Node.js errors](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors) eg. coming from the underlying connection.\n\nQuery errors will contain a stored error with the origin of the query to aid in tracing errors.\n\nQuery errors will also contain the `query` string and the `parameters`. These are not enumerable to avoid accidentally leaking confidential information in logs. To log these it is required to specifically access `error.query` and `error.parameters`, or set `debug: true` in options.\n\nThere are also the following errors specifically for this library.\n\n##### UNSAFE_TRANSACTION\n> Only use sql.begin or max: 1\n\nTo ensure statements in a transaction runs on the same connection (which is required for them to run inside the transaction), you must use [`sql.begin(...)`](#transactions) or only allow a single connection in options (`max: 1`).\n\n##### UNDEFINED_VALUE\n> Undefined values are not allowed\n\nPostgres.js won't accept `undefined` as values in tagged template queries since it becomes ambiguous what to do with the value. If you want to set something to null, use `null` explicitly.\n\n##### MESSAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED\n> X (X) is not supported\n\nWhenever a message is received from Postgres which is not supported by this library. Feel free to file an issue if you think something is missing.\n\n##### MAX_PARAMETERS_EXCEEDED\n> Max number of parameters (65534) exceeded\n\nThe postgres protocol doesn't allow more than 65534 (16bit) parameters. If you run into this issue there are various workarounds such as using `sql([...])` to escape values instead of passing them as parameters.\n\n##### SASL_SIGNATURE_MISMATCH\n> Message type X not supported\n\nWhen using SASL authentication the server responds with a signature at the end of the authentication flow which needs to match the one on the client. This is to avoid [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). If you receive this error the connection was canceled because the server did not reply with the expected signature.\n\n##### NOT_TAGGED_CALL\n> Query not called as a tagged template literal\n\nMaking queries has to be done using the sql function as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). This is to ensure parameters are serialized and passed to Postgres as query parameters with correct types and to avoid SQL injection.\n\n##### AUTH_TYPE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED\n> Auth type X not implemented\n\nPostgres supports many different authentication types. This one is not supported.\n\n##### CONNECTION_CLOSED\n> write CONNECTION_CLOSED host:port\n\nThis error is thrown if the connection was closed without an error. This should not happen during normal operations, so please create an issue if this was unexpected.\n\n##### CONNECTION_ENDED\n> write CONNECTION_ENDED host:port\n\nThis error is thrown if the user has called [`sql.end()`](#teardown--cleanup) and performed a query afterward.\n\n##### CONNECTION_DESTROYED\n> write CONNECTION_DESTROYED host:port\n\nThis error is thrown for any queries that were pending when the timeout to [`sql.end({ timeout: X })`](#teardown--cleanup) was reached.\n\n##### CONNECTION_CONNECT_TIMEOUT\n> write CONNECTION_CONNECT_TIMEOUT host:port\n\nThis error is thrown if the startup phase of the connection (tcp, protocol negotiation, and auth) took more than the default 30 seconds or what was specified using `connect_timeout` or `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT`.\n\n## TypeScript support\n\n`postgres` has TypeScript support. You can pass a row list type for your queries in this way:\n```ts\ninterface User {\n  id: number\n  name: string\n}\n\nconst users = await sql<User[]>`SELECT * FROM users`\nusers[0].id // ok => number\nusers[1].name // ok => string\nusers[0].invalid // fails: `invalid` does not exists on `User`\n```\n\nHowever, be sure to check the array length to avoid accessing properties of `undefined` rows:\n```ts\nconst users = await sql<User[]>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`\nif (!users.length)\n  throw new Error('Not found')\nreturn users[0]\n```\n\nYou can also prefer destructuring when you only care about a fixed number of rows.\nIn this case, we recommend you to prefer using tuples to handle `undefined` properly:\n```ts\nconst [user]: [User?] = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`\nif (!user) // => User | undefined\n  throw new Error('Not found')\nreturn user // => User\n\n// NOTE:\nconst [first, second]: [User?] = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}` // fails: `second` does not exist on `[User?]`\nconst [first, second] = await sql<[User?]>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}` // don't fail : `second: User | undefined`\n```\n\nWe do our best to type all the public API, however types are not always updated when features are added or changed. Feel free to open an issue if you have trouble with types.\n\n## Migration tools\n\nPostgres.js doesn't come with any migration solution since it's way out of scope, but here are some modules that support Postgres.js for migrations:\n\n- https://github.com/porsager/postgres-shift\n- https://github.com/lukeed/ley\n- https://github.com/JAForbes/pgmg\n\n## Thank you\n\nA really big thank you to [@JAForbes](https://twitter.com/jmsfbs) who introduced me to Postgres and still holds my hand navigating all the great opportunities we have.\n\nThanks to [@ACXgit](https://twitter.com/andreacoiutti) for initial tests and dogfooding.\n\nAlso thanks to [Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry) for letting me have the `postgres` npm package name.",

Returns a promise that resolves or rejects the same value or error as `fn`. All functions are executed in the same order in which they were passed to `limit`. `fn` must return a promise.\n\n* `fn` a function that is called with no arguments and returns a promise.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

        "licenseTxt": "Railroad-diagram Generator\n==========================\n\nThis is a small js library for generating railroad diagrams\n(like what [JSON.org](http://json.org) uses)\nusing SVG.\n\nRailroad diagrams are a way of visually representing a grammar\nin a form that is more readable than using regular expressions or BNF.\nI think (though I haven't given it a lot of thought yet) that if it's easy to write a context-free grammar for the language,\nthe corresponding railroad diagram will be easy as well.\n\nThere are several railroad-diagram generators out there, but none of them had the visual appeal I wanted.\n[Here's an example of how they look!](http://www.xanthir.com/etc/railroad-diagrams/example.html)\nAnd [here's an online generator for you to play with and get SVG code from!](http://www.xanthir.com/etc/railroad-diagrams/generator.html)\n\nThe library now exists in a Python port as well!  See the information further down.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nTo use the library, just include the js and css files, and then call the Diagram() function.\nIts arguments are the components of the diagram (Diagram is a special form of Sequence).\nAn alternative to Diagram() is ComplexDiagram() which is used to describe a complex type diagram.\nComponents are either leaves or containers.\n\nThe leaves:\n* Terminal(text) or a bare string - represents literal text\n* NonTerminal(text) - represents an instruction or another production\n* Comment(text) - a comment\n* Skip() - an empty line\n\nThe containers:\n* Sequence(children) - like simple concatenation in a regex\n* Choice(index, children) - like | in a regex.  The index argument specifies which child is the \"normal\" choice and should go in the middle\n* Optional(child, skip) - like ? in a regex.  A shorthand for `Choice(1, [Skip(), child])`.  If the optional `skip` parameter has the value `\"skip\"`, it instead puts the Skip() in the straight-line path, for when the \"normal\" behavior is to omit the item.\n* OneOrMore(child, repeat) - like + in a regex.  The 'repeat' argument is optional, and specifies something that must go between the repetitions.\n* ZeroOrMore(child, repeat, skip) - like * in a regex.  A shorthand for `Optional(OneOrMore(child, repeat))`.  The optional `skip` parameter is identical to Optional().\n\nFor convenience, each component can be called with or without `new`.\nIf called without `new`,\nthe container components become n-ary;\nthat is, you can say either `new Sequence([A, B])` or just `Sequence(A,B)`.\n\nAfter constructing a Diagram, call `.format(...padding)` on it, specifying 0-4 padding values (just like CSS) for some additional \"breathing space\" around the diagram (the paddings default to 20px).\n\nThe result can either be `.toString()`'d for the markup, or `.toSVG()`'d for an `<svg>` element, which can then be immediately inserted to the document.  As a convenience, Diagram also has an `.addTo(element)` method, which immediately converts it to SVG and appends it to the referenced element with default paddings. `element` defaults to `document.body`.\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nThere are a few options you can tweak, at the bottom of the file.  Just tweak either until the diagram looks like what you want.\nYou can also change the CSS file - feel free to tweak to your heart's content.\nNote, though, that if you change the text sizes in the CSS,\nyou'll have to go adjust the metrics for the leaf nodes as well.\n\n* VERTICAL_SEPARATION - sets the minimum amount of vertical separation between two items.  Note that the stroke width isn't counted when computing the separation; this shouldn't be relevant unless you have a very small separation or very large stroke width.\n* ARC_RADIUS - the radius of the arcs used in the branching containers like Choice.  This has a relatively large effect on the size of non-trivial diagrams.  Both tight and loose values look good, depending on what you're going for.\n* DIAGRAM_CLASS - the class set on the root `<svg>` element of each diagram, for use in the CSS stylesheet.\n* STROKE_ODD_PIXEL_LENGTH - the default stylesheet uses odd pixel lengths for 'stroke'. Due to rasterization artifacts, they look best when the item has been translated half a pixel in both directions. If you change the styling to use a stroke with even pixel lengths, you'll want to set this variable to `false`.\n* INTERNAL_ALIGNMENT - when some branches of a container are narrower than others, this determines how they're aligned in the extra space.  Defaults to \"center\", but can be set to \"left\" or \"right\".\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nAt this early stage, the generator is feature-complete and works as intended, but still has several TODOs:\n\n* The font-sizes are hard-coded right now, and the font handling in general is very dumb - I'm just guessing at some metrics that are probably \"good enough\" rather than measuring things properly.\n\nPython Port\n-----------\n\nIn addition to the canonical JS version, the library now exists as a Python library as well.\n\nUsing it is basically identical.  The config variables are globals in the file, and so may be adjusted either manually or via tweaking from inside your program.\n\nThe main difference from the JS port is how you extract the string from the Diagram.  You'll find a `writeSvg(writerFunc)` method on `Diagram`, which takes a callback of one argument and passes it the string form of the diagram.  For example, it can be used like `Diagram(...).writeSvg(sys.stdout.write)` to write to stdout.  **Note**: the callback will be called multiple times as it builds up the string, not just once with the whole thing.  If you need it all at once, consider something like a `StringIO` as an easy way to collect it into a single string.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis document and all associated files in the github project are licensed under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) ![](http://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/80x15.png).\nThis means you can reuse, remix, or otherwise appropriate this project for your own use **without restriction**.\n(The actual legal meaning can be found at the above link.)\nDon't ask me for permission to use any part of this project, **just use it**.\nI would appreciate attribution, but that is not required by the license.",

For the purposes\n    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n    \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n    the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n    as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n    meet the following conditions:\n\n    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n        stating that You changed the files; and\n\n    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n        the Derivative Works; and\n\n    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n        as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You receive two events `reading` and `writing`-- no magic is performed.\n\nThis works well with [duplexify](https://github.com/mafintosh/duplexify) or lazy streams, so you can wait until you know you're being used as a stream to do something asynchronous, such as fetching an API token.\n\n\n## Use\n```sh\n$ npm install --save stream-events\n```\n```js\nvar stream = require('stream')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar util = require('util')\n\nfunction MyStream() {\n  stream.Duplex.call(this)\n  streamEvents.call(this)\n}\nutil.inherits(MyStream, stream.Duplex)\n\nMyStream.prototype._read = function(chunk) {\n  console.log('_read called as usual')\n  this.push(new Buffer(chunk))\n  this.push(null)\n}\n\nMyStream.prototype._write = function() {\n  console.log('_write called as usual')\n}\n\nvar stream = new MyStream\n\nstream.on('reading', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being asked for data')\n})\n\nstream.on('writing', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being sent data')\n})\n\nstream.pipe(stream)\n```\n\n### Using with Duplexify\n```js\nvar duplexify = require('duplexify')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nvar dup = streamEvents(duplexify())\n\ndup.on('writing', function() {\n  // do something async\n  dup.setWritable(/*writable stream*/)\n})\n\nfs.createReadStream('file').pipe(dup)\n```",

        "licenseTxt": "## Typed Event Emitter\n\n**NOTE: REQUIRES TYPESCRIPT 3.0**\n\nA TypeScript library for strongly typed event emitters in 0 kB. Declare events using a simple interface mapping event names to their payloads to get stricter versions of `emit`, `on`, and other common EventEmitter APIs. Works with any kind of EventEmitter.\n\n### Installation\n\n```\nnpm i strict-event-emitter-types\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```ts\nimport StrictEventEmitter from 'strict-event-emitter-types';\n\n// define your events\ninterface Events {\n  request: (request: Request, response: Response) => void;\n  done: void;\n}\n\n// grab an event emitter\nimport { EventEmitter } from 'events';\n\n// Create strict event emitter types\nlet ee: StrictEventEmitter<EventEmitter, Events> = new EventEmitter;\n\n// now enjoy your strongly typed EventEmitter API!🎉\n\nee.on('request', (r, resp) => ... );\n// r and resp are contextually typed to Request and Response\n\nee.on('somethingElse');\n// Error: unknown event\n\nee.on('done', x => x);\n// Error: The 'done' event does not have a payload\n\nee.emit('request', new Request());\n// Error: missing event payload (the response)\n\nee.emit('request', new Request(), false);\n// Error: incorrect payload type\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n#### Event Records\n\nEvent records are interfaces or object types that map event names to the event's payload types. In the following example, three events are declared:\n\n```ts\ninterface Events {\n  req: (request: Request, response: Response) => void;\n  done: void;\n  conn: Connection;\n}\n```\n\nEach event shows one of three ways to type the event payloads:\n\n1.  **Function type:** Parameters are the event payload. The return type is ignored.\n1.  **`void`:** A shortcut for an event with no payload, i.e. `() => void`\n1.  **Anything else:** A shortcut for an event with one payload, for example `(p: number) => void` can be written as just `number`.\n\n#### StrictEventEmitter&lt;TEmitterType, TEventRecord, TEmitRecord>\n\nThe default export. A generic type that takes three type parameters:\n\n1.  _TEmitterType_: Your EventEmitter type (e.g. node's EventEmitter or socket.io socket)\n2.  _TEventRecord_: A type mapping event names to event payloads\n3.  _TEmitRecord_: Optionally, a similar type mapping things you can emit.\n\nThe third parameter is handy when typing web sockets where client and server can listen to and emit different events. For example, if you are using socket.io:\n\n```ts\n// create types representing the server side and client\n// side sockets\nexport type ServerSocket =\n  StrictEventEmitter<SocketIO.Socket, EventsFromServer, EventsFromClient>;\nexport type ClientSocket =\n  StrictEventEmitter<SocketIOClient.Socket, EventsFromClient, EventsFromServer>;\n\n// elsewhere on server\nlet serverSocket: ServerSocket = new SocketIO.Socket();\nserverSocket.on(/* only events that are sent from the client are allowed */, ...)\nserverSocket.emit(/* only events that are emitted from the server are allowed */, ...)\n\n// elsewhere on client\nlet clientSocket: ClientSocket = new SocketIOClient.Socket();\nclientSocket.on(/* only events that are sent from the server are allowed */, ...)\nclientSocket.emit(/* only events that are emitted from the client are allowed */, ...)\n```\n\n##### Usage with Subclasses\n\nTo subclass an EventEmitter you need to cast the base EventEmitter to the strict EventEmitter before extending:\n\n```ts\ntype MyEmitter = StrictEventEmitter<EventEmitter, Events>;\n\nclass MyEventEmitter extends (EventEmitter as { new(): MyEmitter }) {\n  doEmit() {\n    this.emit(...); // strict\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### StrictBroadcast&lt;TStrictEventEmitter>\n\nA type for a function which takes (and strictly checks) an emit event and a payload. _TStrictEventEmitter_ is the event emitter type instantiated from StrictEventEmitter.\n\nUseful for broadcast abstractions. It is not possible to contextually type assigments to this type, so your declarations will look something like this:\n\n```ts\nimport { StrictBroadcast } from 'strict-event-emitter-types';\n\nconst broadcast: StrictBroadcast<ServerSocket> = function(\n  event: string,\n  payload?: any\n) {\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\nNote that the loose types for event and payload only apply inside the broadcast function (consumers will see a much stricter signature). Declaring more precise parameter types or narrowing using type guards would allow strongly-typed dispatching to emitters.",

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

It is also tested against the official test suite (including extended tests).\n\n## Creation\n\nIn Node:\n```javascript\nvar uriTemplates = require('uri-templates');\nvar template1 = uriTemplates(\"/date/{colour}/{shape}/\");\n```\n\nIn browser:\n```javascript\nvar template2 = new UriTemplate(\"/prefix/{?params*}\");\n```\n\n## Substitution using an object\n```javascript\n// \"/categories/green/round/\"\nvar uri1 = template1.fill({colour: \"green\", shape: \"round\"});\n\n// \"/prefix/?a=A&b=B&c=C\nvar uri2 = template2.fillFromObject({\n\tparams: {a: \"A\", b: \"B\", c: \"C\"}\n});\n```\n\n## Substitution using a callback\n```javascript\n// \"/categories/example_colour/example_shape/\"\nvar uri1b = template1.fill(function (varName) {\n\treturn \"example_\" + varName;\n});\n```\n\n## Guess variables from URI (\"de-substitution\")\n\n```javascript\nvar uri2b = \"/prefix/?beep=boop&bleep=bloop\";\nvar params = template2.fromUri(url2b);\n/*\n\t{\n\t\tparams: {\n\t\t\tbeep: \"boop\",\n\t\t\tbleep: \"bloop\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n*/\n```\n\nWhile templates can be ambiguous (e.g. `\"{var1}{var2}\"`), it will still produce *something* that reconstructs into the original URI.\n\nIt can handle all the cases in the official test suite, including the extended tests:\n\n```javascript\nvar template = uriTemplate(\"{/id*}{?fields,token}\");\n\nvar values = template.fromUri(\"/person/albums?fields=id,name,picture&token=12345\");\n/*\n{\n\tid: [\"person\", 'albums\"],\n\tfields: [\"id\", \"name\", \"picture\"],\n\ttoken: \"12345\"\n}\n*/\n```\n\n### `strict` option\n\nSometimes, you might want a more exact match, instead of a best guess.  For example, this could be useful when using URI Templates for routing.\n\nThe `strict` option performs more checks, to see whether the URI being matched is plausible:\n\n```javascript\nvar template = uriTemplate(\"/prefix/{value}/{suffix}\");\n\n// Matches, even though \"foo/bar\" contains a \"/\" which is not allowed\nvar looseMatch = template.fromUri('/prefix/foo/bar/suffix');\n// Does not match\nvar strictMatch = template.fromUri('/prefix/foo/bar/suffix', {strict: true});\n\n```\n\n## Test URI\n\n```javascript\nvar uri2b = \"/prefix/?beep=boop&bleep=bloop\";\nvar isMatch = template2.test(url2b); // === true\n```\n\nThis returns a boolean, and takes the same options as `.fromUri()`.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is released as [public-domain](http://geraintluff.github.io/tv4/LICENSE.txt).

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
